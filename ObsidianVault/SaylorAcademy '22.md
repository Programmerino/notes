## Extracts
### Academic FP
Functional programming has its roots in academia , evolving from the lambda calculus , a formal system of computation based only on functions. Functional programming has historically been less popular than imperative programming, but many functional languages are seeing use today in industry and education, including Common Lisp, Scheme, Clojure, Wolfram Language, Racket, Erlang, OCaml, Haskell, and F#. Functional programming is also key to some languages that have found success in specific domains, like R in statistics,Â  J, K, and Q in financial analysis, and XQuery / XSLT for XML. Domain-specific declarative languages like SQL and Lex / Yacc use some elements of functional programming, such as not allowing mutable values. In addition, many other programming languages support programming in a functional style or have implemented features from functional programming, such as C++11, Kotlin, Perl, PHP, Python, and Scala.
