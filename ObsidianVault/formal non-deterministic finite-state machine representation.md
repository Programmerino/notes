The formal model for a nondeterministic [[finite-state machine]] is similar to [[formal FSM representation]], however, *update* is replaced with *possibleUpdates*, a relation rather than a function mapping to a set of possible (next [[state]], output [[valuation]]) pairs, and *initialStates* instead of *initialState*. The signature for *possibleUpdates* is $States \times Inputs \rightarrow 2^{States \times Outputs}$ where $2^x$ denotes the power set of $x$.
