A [[system]] with feedback has an [[output]] feeding into a prior [[actor]], and often appear in [[system]]s which seek to compensate for error. The value used in the feedback is also called the feedback, and the [[CPS signal]] produced from it is called the correction [[CPS signal]]. Since it can normally only affect future errors, the [[system]] usually includes at least one strictly [[causal]] [[actor]].
