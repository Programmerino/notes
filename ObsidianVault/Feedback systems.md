A system with feedback has an output feeding into a prior actor, and often appear in systems which seek to compensate for error. The value used in the feedback is also called the feedback, and the signal produced from it is called the correction signal. Since it can normally only affect future errors, the system usually includes at least one strictly causal actor.
