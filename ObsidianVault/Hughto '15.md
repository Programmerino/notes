### Overview
Transgender stigma exists reduces opportunities and negatively affects general health. Stigma prevention is suggested. There is structural (norms and policies which constrain opportunity), interpersonal (direct harassment, violence, etc.), and individual stigma (internal beliefs against themselves or beliefs they perceive others to have in them). All three are highly prevalent in transgender people. Adverse health outcomes like depression, anxiety, suicidality, substance abuse, and HIV are likely caused by increased stress and reduced access to "health protective resources" (e.g. knowledge, money, power).

#### Transgender means mismatch between birth sex and expression
==Transgender is== as an umbrella term used to define ==individuals whose== gender identity or ==expression differs from== the culturally bound gender associated with one's assigned ==birth sex== (i.e., male or female) (Davidson, 2007; Valentine, 2007). While there is considerable variability in who falls under the transgender umbrella, it is estimated that 0.03e0.05% of the population are transgender (Conron et al., 2012; Gates, 2011; Reisner et al., 2014a). Transgender individuals define their gender identity (e.g., man, woman, transgender man, transgender woman, genderqueer, bigender, butch queen, femme queen) and express their gender in a variety of ways, which may vary according to racial/ethnic background, socio-economic status, and place of residence (Valentine, 2007). Some transgender individuals choose to socially transition (e.g., change their name, pronoun, gender expression) and/or medically transition (e.g., cross-sex hormones, surgery) to align their gender expression with their gender identity, while others choose to have a gender expression or identity outside of the traditional gender binary (e.g. gender nonconforming people) (Davidson, 2007). In the US, transgender individuals are considered deviant for having a gender identity or expression that is discordant with the gender typically associated with their assigned birth sex and experience widespread stigma as a result (Bockting et al., 2013; Grant et al., 2011; Lombardi et al., 2002).
