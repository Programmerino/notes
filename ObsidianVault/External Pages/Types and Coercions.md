# Types and Coercions

Hakaru is a simply-typed language which has a few basic types and some more complicated ones which can be built out of simpler types.

## Types

-   nat is the type for natural numbers. This includes zero.
-   int is the integer type.
-   prob is the type for positive real number. This includes zero.
-   real is the type for real numbers.
-   array(x) is the type for arrays where each element is type x
-   measure(x) is the type for probability distributions whose sample space is type x

## Coercions

For the primitive numeric types we also offer coercion functions.

-   prob2real
-   int2real
-   nat2int
-   real2prob
-   real2int
-   int2nat

For the ones which are always safe to apply such as `nat2int` we will automatically insert them if it is required for the program to typecheck.
