# Density

The density transform (`density`) finds the density of a probability distribution at a particular point. This transform is a specialized form of the [`disintegrate` transform](http://hakaru-dev.github.io/transforms/disintegrate/) that also computes the [expectation](http://hakaru-dev.github.io/transforms/expect/) of the probabilistic distribution as part of its work.

## Usage

Your Hakaru program must be a probability distribution (type `measure(x)`) in order to use the `density` transform. Most Hakaru programs that end with a `return` statement do not meet this requirement because they return values instead of functions on values.

You can use the `density` transform in the command line by calling:

```
density hakaru_program.hk
```

This transformation will produce a new Hakaru program containing an [anonymous function](http://hakaru-dev.github.io/lang/functions/) representing the density function for that model.

## Example

The normal distribution is a commonly used distribution in probabilistic modeling. A simple Hakaru program modelling the simplest normal distribution is:

```
normal(0,1)
```

Assuming that this program is named `norm.hk`, we can calculate the density function for this distribution by running:

```
density norm.hk
```

**Note:** The output for `density` will be printed in the console. You can easily save this program to a file by redirecting the output to a file by calling `density model1.hk > model2.hk`. For this example, we will call our new program `norm_density.hk`.

When you open the new Hakaru program, `norm_density.hk`, you will find an anonymous Hakaru function. You can then assign values to the function’s arguments to test the probabilistic density at a specific point in the model.

```
fn x0 real: 
 (exp((negate(((x0 + 0) ^ 2)) / 2)) / 1 / sqrt((2 * pi)) / 1)
```

For example, if you wanted to test the density at `0.2`, you could alter `norm_density.hk` to:

```
normalDensity = fn x0 real: 
 (exp((negate(((x0 + 0) ^ 2)) / 2)) / 1 / sqrt((2 * pi)) / 1)

return normalDensity(0.2)
```

You could then use the [`hakaru` command](http://hakaru-dev.github.io/intro/samplegen/) to have Hakaru compute the density:

```
$ hakaru norm_density.hk | head -n 1
0.3910426939754559
```

**Note:** If the argument `head -n 1` is omitted, the `hakaru` command will print out the resulting density value indefinitely.
