# Functions

Functions can be defined using a Python-inspired style syntax. One notable difference is that each argument must be followed by its type.

```
def add(x real, y real):
    x + y

add(4,5)
```

We may optionally provide a type for the return value of a function if we wish.

```
def add(x real, y real) real:
    x + y

add(4,5)
```

## Anonymous functions

If you donâ€™t wish to name your functions, we also offer a syntax for anonymous functions. These only take on argument and must be given a type alongside the variable name.

```
fn x real: x + 1
```

Internally, there are only one argument anonymous functions, and lets. The first example is equivalent to the following.

```
add = fn x real:
         fn y real:
            x + y
add(4,5)
```
