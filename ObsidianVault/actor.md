An actor is a function mapping functions of type $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ to other functions of type $\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ alongside some parameters akin to free variables which can be used in the functions. When displayed in a graph, they are boxes with input signals and output signals.
* When they are composed, it is called [[cascade composition]]
* They can be quite clearly translated into the representation used in [[Functional Reactive Programming]]
* Common actors include...
	* [[Scale actor]]
	* [[Integrator actor]]
	* [[Signal adder]]
