* Models the dynamics and evolution of a [[CPS|system]] state over time with formal properties which are predictive of the real physical system, used in [[CPS]]
	* The dynamics can be [[Continuous Dynamics in CPS|continuous]] or [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS|discrete]].
* Are used to gain a deeper understanding of a [[CPS|system]] through imitation, and specifies concretely what a [[CPS|system]] does through a process of design and analysisâ€¦
	* Design is the structured creation of artifacts, specifying **how** a [[CPS|system]] does what it does
	* Analysis dissects a [[CPS|system]] to gain a deeper understanding, the **why**.
* It has high fidelity if it accurately describes the properties of a [[CPS|system]], and abstracts if it is omitting details.
* Are typically represented with a series of interconnected [[actor]]s (see [[model communication]] for more information). These can all be represented with a single [[side-by-side composition|side-by-side composite]] actor with [[Feedback systems|feedback]].
* Complicated [[CPS|system]]s should be described in terms of [[state machine composition|compositions]] of simpler [[CPS|system]]s
* The rules of notation of a model are called its **syntax** and the meaning of the notation is called its **semantics**.
