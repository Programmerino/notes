The discrete-event [[MoC]] (DE/DEVS) is a very popular extension of [[Moore machine]]s and associates with all [[CPS event]]s a time stamp, and each [[actor]] reacts to [[input]] [[CPS event]]s in timestamp-order, and produces [[output]]s in timestamp-order.

To execute a DE [[CPS model]], an **event queue** is used which is initially potentially populated by the initial [[CPS event]]s of the [[actors]] in the [[system]], and then executed by continuously sending the earliest [[CPS event]] in the queue to the appropriate [[actor]] and pushing the result to the queue in the correct place. What this timestamp is is variant-dependent, as some allow instantaneous timestamps, and some require strictly larger time stamps.

A popular way to handle the instantaneous timestamps case is to treat DE as a generalization of [[SR]], and instead of choosing one of the earliest, we choose all events with the earliest timestamp and execute them in a [[fixed point]] iteration (see [[finding the fixed-point solution for synchronous-reactive state machines]]). With this solution, [[actor]]s which wish to have their [[output]] be non-simultaneous use some kind of built-in delay mechanism to have their [[CPS event]]s be posted later.
