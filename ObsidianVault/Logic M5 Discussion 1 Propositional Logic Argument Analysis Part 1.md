> The following was taken from a newspaper column written by Doug Kroker (Letter 8): If the death penalty deters one person from becoming a murderer, it is effective. There are also some other important reasons for having the death penalty. First, the families and friends of innocent victims have the right to see effective retribution. Second, terminating the life of a killer is more economical than keeping him in jail at the taxpayer's expense. Third, everyone will have greater respect for the judicial system when justice is carried out.

1. The death penalty deters one person from becoming a murderer ($p$) $\rightarrow$ the death penalty is effective
2. $p$
3. $P(x) =$ $x$ gives the families and friends of innocent victims the ability to exercise their right to see effective retribution is good ($Q(x)$) $\rightarrow$ we should have $x$
4. $P(\text{the death penalty})$
5. $Q(\text{the death penalty})$
6. $S(x) = x$ terminates the life of a killer and thus is more economical than keeping \[them\] in jail at the taxpayer's expense ($T(x)$) $\rightarrow$ we should have $x$
7. $S(\text{the death penalty})$
8. $T(\text{the death penalty})$
9. $U(x) =$ $x$ gives everyone greater respect for the judicial system since it carries out justice ($V(x)$) $\rightarrow$ we should have $x$
10. $U(\text{the death penalty})$
11. $V(\text{the death penalty})$
12. Therefore, we should have the death penalty

The way I have rendered the argument would make is logically valid, since the conclusion "we should have the death penalty" is always supported in conditional statements where the antecedent is a given premise. Whether or not it is sound is more difficult. I don't believe that people have a right to "effective retribution", which would make the premise held in $Q(x)$ false. I also don't agree that just because something is economical, that we should strive towards that thing, which would make the premise in $T(x)$ false. Finally, I don't believe that the death penalty gives everyone greater respect for the judicial system. One argument that comes to mind is that the magnitude of justice is increased, but the risk is equally heightened of an unjust ruling which counters the value of the justice. I also don't agree that anything which increases respect for the judicial system is valuable. This means that $U(\text{the death penalty)}$ and $U(x)$ are false respectively. Since the relevant premises are incorrect, particularly since each sub-argument for the death penalty contains a false premise, the argument is unsound.
