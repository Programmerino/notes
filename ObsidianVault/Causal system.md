A system is causal if its output only depends on current and past inputs, and is defined as…
* For a [[continuous-time system|continuous-time signal]] $x: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow A$ where $\left.x\right|_{t \leq \tau}$ is the "current and past inputs” at time $\tau$, then a [[continuous-time system]] $S: A^\mathbb{R} \rightarrow B^\mathbb{R}$ is causal if $\forall_{x_1,x_2 \in A^\mathbb{R}}\forall_{\tau\in\mathbb{R}}\left(\left.x_1\right|_{t \leq \tau}=\left.\left.x_2\right|_{t \leq \tau} \Rightarrow S\left(x_1\right)\right|_{t \leq \tau}=\left.S\left(x_2\right)\right|_{t \leq \tau}\right)$. That is, if two inputs are identical up to $\tau$, then the outputs are identical up to $\tau$. It is strictly causal if $\leq$ is changed to $<$ (typically used in [[feedback systems]]).
