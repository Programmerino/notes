Convert the previous Markdown notes to a list of self-contained, independent statements to be input into a spaced-repetition learning program. The program supports code blocks using the ```code here``` syntax and math blocks using the "<latex>latex here</latex>" syntax. Do not use the dollar syntax for math ever, it must always use the above syntax. Everything else must be plaintext. Add to each statement all the context and additional information needed to understand it such that each statement can be studied independently from the others. The information of each statement in the list should not be reliant on the information from previous statements. If a piece of information cannot meet these requirements, for example, if a statement must reference an image or other contextual information, you must skip it.
