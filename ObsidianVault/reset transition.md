A reset [[transition]] in the context of [[hierarchical composition]] means that whenever a [[state]] with a [[state refinement|refinement]] is reached, its state is always initially the initial [[state]] specified for that [[finite-state machine]]. This is opposed to a [[history transition]] which does not "reset" the state. It is designated graphically as an empty arrowhead (see [[Pasted image 20221225140003.png|here]])
