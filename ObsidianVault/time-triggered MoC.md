The time-triggered [[MoC]]/architecture (TTA) is a [[timed MoC]] invented in [[Kopetz94]] designed to be fault tolerant, and is similar to [[SR]] with the exception that computations are not [[simultaneous and instantaneous]], but execute over the span of a [[logical execution time]] and thus [[output]]s produced by [[actor]]s are not visible to other computations until the *next* tick of the global clock. This makes all [[system]]s implemented with it [[constructive]], and without any [[race condition]]s.
