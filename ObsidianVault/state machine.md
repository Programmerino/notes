* State machines are used to model [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS]] and are the combination of [[state|states]] and [[CPS signal|signals]] and are reactive to an [[environment]]. See the [[counter state machine]] for an example.
* They can be categorized in several waysâ€¦
	* [[Finite-state machine]]
	* [[Determinate state machine]]
	* [[Deterministic state machine]]
	* [[non-deterministic state machine]]
	* [[Receptive state machine]]
* See [[state machine syntax]]
