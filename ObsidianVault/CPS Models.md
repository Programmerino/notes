* Models the dynamics and evolution of a system state over time with formal properties which are predictive of the real physical system, used in [[CPS]]
	* The dynamics can be [[Continuous Dynamics in CPS|continuous]] or [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS|discrete]].
* Are used to gain a deeper understanding of a system through imitation, and specifies concretely what a system does through a process of design and analysisâ€¦
	* Design is the structured creation of artifacts, specifying **how** a system does what it does
	* Analysis dissects a system to gain a deeper understanding, the **why**.
* It has high fidelity if it accurately describes the properties of a system, and abstracts if it is omitting details.
* Are typically represented with a series of linked [[actor]]s
* Complicated systems should be described in terms of compositions of simpler systems
* The rules of notation of a model are called its **syntax** and the meaning of the notation is called its **semantics**.
