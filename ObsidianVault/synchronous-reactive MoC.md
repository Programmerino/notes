The synchronous-reactive (SR) [[model of computation]] specifies a [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS|discrete system]] where [[signal]]s are absent at all times except potentially at ticks of a global clock. The [[CPS models|model]] is executed with global reactions occurring at discrete times with all [[reaction]]s being [[simultaneous and instantaneous]]. With this model, any connection from an [[output]] [[port]] to an [[input]] [[port]] means the input port is the same as the value at the output port at all times.
