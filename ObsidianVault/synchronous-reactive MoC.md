The synchronous-reactive (SR) [[model of computation]] specifies a [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS|discrete system]] where [[CPS signal]]s are absent at all times except potentially at ticks of a global clock. The [[CPS model|model]] is executed with global reactions occurring at discrete times with all [[reaction]]s being [[simultaneous and instantaneous]]. With this model, any connection from an [[output]] [[port]] to an [[input]] [[port]] means the [[input]] [[port]] is the same as the value at the [[output]] [[port]] at all times.

[[Deterministic state machine]]s under this model can have their [[port]]s calculated by finding the [[fixed point]] of the [[firing function]] (when $s(n) = a_i(s(n))$ where $s(n)$ is the value of the [[CPS signal]] $s$ at the $n$-th [[reaction]]) at each step, carrying out [[state]] [[transition]]s in between.

When there is exactly one [[finding the fixed-point solution for synchronous-reactive state machines|solution]] for this [[fixed point]] for all [[reachability|reachable]] [[state]]s, the system is **well formed**, otherwise, it is **ill formed** (or perhaps [[non-deterministic]] in the case of more than one [[fixed point]]s, although these semantics lead to [[determinism]] no longer being a [[compositional property]])
