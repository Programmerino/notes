A motor is an [[actuator]] which applies [[torque]] proportional to the [[current]]. They can also serve as a generator when [[torque]] is applied to it instead.

The [[voltage]] and [[current]] running through the motor is modeled by $v(t)=R i(t)+L \frac{d i(t)}{d t}+k_b \omega(t)$ where $R$ is [[resistance]] and $L$ is [[inductance]] where $k_b$ is the [[back electromagnetic force]] constant (typically in [[volts]] per revolutions per minute).

The [[torque]] can be modeled with $I \frac{d \omega(t)}{d t}=k_T i(t)-\eta \omega(t)-\tau(t)$ where $k_T$ is the **motor torque constant**, $\eta$ is the [[kinetic friction]], and $\tau$ is the torque applied.
