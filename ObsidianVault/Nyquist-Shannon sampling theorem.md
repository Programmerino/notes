The Nyquist-Shannon [[sampling]] theorem states that a [[discrete]] [[CPS signal]] at a [[sampling rate]] $R$ composed of [[sine waves]] of [[frequencies]] less than $R/2$ will be unique for only that [[continuous]] [[function]]. This means that [[aliasing]] is impossible when this rule is followed.
