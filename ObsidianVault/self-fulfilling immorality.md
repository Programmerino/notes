Self-fulfilling immorality is an instance of the self-fulfilling prophecy in that under Consequentialism, actions considered to be immoral by the society they are witnessed by become immoral since they cause outcry and displeasure to those who witness them. For example, violations of the first amendment by no means are inherently immoral, and in many cases are not immoral, but become immoral since they cause intense sensations of disgust and displeasure in those who witness them. This has the rather surprising effect that many deontological rules popular in a society becomes de facto rules in consequentialist moral systems. An important thing to note is that this does not hold in the other direction, both because deontological systems usually prohibit actions rather than prescribe actions (or at least prohibit more often than prescribe), and because people are not made happy by moral actions to the same frequency, magnitude, and extent as they are made unhappy by immoral actions. For example, a pro-choice advocate would be quite unhappy to see someone be unable to have an abortion while they aren't necessarily happy to see someone undergo an abortion.
### Why Its Often Weak
This concept shouldn't be applied to words with [[immorality connotations]]. For example, if we were to overextend this idea without considering this, we would predict that affirmative action (since it is an instance of discrimination on the basis of race) would be widely despised, however, that doesn't appear to be true. The reason is that affirmative action often isn't considered racist since many consider it to be moral.
