The thermostat [[hybrid systems modeling|hybrid system]] has states heating and cooling and accepts a [[continuous-time system|continuous-time signal]] $\tau : \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ where $\tau(t)$ is the temperature at time $t$. The transition out of cooling occurs at the soonest instant where $\tau(t) \leq 18$.
