### Perceived discrimination is directly linked to physical and mental health problems -- the best evidence proves
Although the expression of outright discrimination has been greatly reduced in recent decades, more subtle and chronic forms of discrimination are still very real for certain groups in our society. A number of comprehensive literature ==reviews find substantial evidence==—from both laboratory and community studies— ==for== the ==harmful== health ==effects of discrim==ination ==across== a range of mental ==health outcomes== including ==depression==, psychological distress, anxiety, and well-being (e.g., [D. R. Williams, Neighbors, & Jackson, 2003](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747726/#R263); [Paradies, 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747726/#R180)). Perceived discrimination has also been linked to specific types of physical health problems, such as hypertension, self-reported poor health, and breast cancer, as well as potential risk factors for ==disease==, such as ==obesity==, high blood pressure, and ==substance use== (see, e.g., [D. R. Williams & Mohammed, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747726/#R262), for a review).
