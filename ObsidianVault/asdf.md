**Induction in philosophy of science, which is the problem of how to justify our belief in the uniformity of nature, and the reliability of our inductive inferences**.
* Another topic to consider is the use of probability in causal inference, which is the process of using observational data to infer cause-and-effect relationships. This is an active area of research in statistics and has applications in fields such as epidemiology, political science, and economics.
* You could consider giving a presentation on the application of Bayesian probability to the problem of induction. The problem of induction is a philosophical problem that asks how we can make predictions about the future based on observations of the past. Bayesian probability provides a framework for addressing this problem by allowing us to update our beliefs about the world as we gather new data. You could discuss the history of the problem of induction, the key contributions of Bayesian probability to our understanding of it, and some examples of real-world applications of Bayesian induction in fields such as science and artificial intelligence.

Applying Bayesian probability to the problem of induction in the philosophy of science and how to justify our belief in the uniformity of nature, and the reliability of our inductive inferences:
* Introduction
	* Background on the Problem of Induction
		* Explain what the problem of induction is and why it's important
		* Summarize some of the key historical developments in the philosophy of science related to induction
	* Introduce the topic of Bayesian probability and its application to the problem of induction in the philosophy of science
		* Explain how it is different from classical probability
		* Connect updating our beliefs to induction
	* Preview the main points of the presentation
* Bayesian Probability and the Problem of Induction
	* Explain how Bayesian probability can be used to justify our belief in the uniformity of nature and the reliability of our inductive inferences
		* Talk about the principle of maximum entropy, which states that, when faced with uncertainty, we should assume the maximum amount of disorder or randomness possible. In other words, we should assume that all possible outcomes are equally likely until we have evidence to suggest otherwise.
			* Explain how this allows us to assign the highest probability to the hypothesis that nature is uniform, without making specific assumptions about the nature of the uniformity.
		* It also provides a mechanism for evaluating the reliability of inductive inferences by providing a way to quantify the degree of certainty in our beliefs, for example, by giving the ability to calculate the probability of a hypothesis given a set of data.
	* Provide examples of how Bayesian probability has been applied in real-world scientific contexts
		* Medical diagnosis and weather forecasting.
