The synchronous/static dataflow (SDF) [[model of computation]] is a [[dataflow MoC]] where each [[actor]] produces a fixed number of [[input]] [[token]]s and a fixed number of [[output]] [[token]]s whenever fired with the goal of solving resource exhaustion through [[bounded buffers]] and disproving [[deadlock]] during [[unbounded execution]]. 

See [[synchronous dataflow MoC scheduling]] and [[initial tokens]] for additional information
