![[Artificial Pancreas Verification Notes]]
* Work with in the Spring, need an advisor by February 2023
* Working on Bachelor-Masters' till Spring 2024, one more semester to wrap up the Master's. Working with for 3 semesters
* TA or research (Principles of Programming)
* What I can do for you:
	* I'm interested in PLT and formal verification, so your CPS verification projects are interesting to me. I've written some projects using Bayesian inference probabilistic programming languages, and I think I saw Bayesian machine learning on your “Predictive Runtime Monitoring Project” page.
	* Dr. Ha with the RL networking schist, didn't touch the RL model that much, I mainly worked on researching the WebRTC implementations in browsers.
	* Willing to help with basic stuff too like databasing, scheduling, etc.
* 10-15 hours
* Lein Satia - https://ptolemy.berkeley.edu/books/leeseshia/
	* Synchronous/dataflow programming languages
		* Lustre synchronous programming
		* Scade - Airbus
		* Modelica 
	* Probabilistic/differentiable programming
	* FRP for real-time cyberphysical systems
* How to extend the research space for this
