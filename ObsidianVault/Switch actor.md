The Switch [[actor]] is a basic [[actor]] used in [[DDF]] which is conceptually the opposite of the [[Select actor]]. It receives an [[input]] on the bottom [[port]] which, if $true$, redirects the next [[input]] on the leftmost [[port]] to the top [[output]], and otherwise redirects it to the bottom [[output]].
