Lee and Tripakis semantics specify that in [[hierarchical composition]], the deepest [[finite-state machine]] [[reaction|reacts]] first, then the next deepest, and so on. Because of the [[simultaneous and instantaneous]] property, only the highest [[state]] being moved to will actually happen. If two [[action]]s happen in the same reaction, they will be performed in sequence, and if they conflict, the later one is preferred.
