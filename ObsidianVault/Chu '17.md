### Extracts
#### IPTS description
The interpersonal theory of suicide posits that suicidal desire emerges when individuals experience intractable feelings of _perceived burdensomeness_ and _thwarted belongingness_ and that near-lethal or lethal suicidal behavior occurs in the presence of suicidal desire and _capability for suicide_.
#### Suicide death number
Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, claiming the lives of over 800,000 individuals annually ([World Health Organization [WHO], 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R233)).
#### Important of frameworks
Such frameworks allow for the systematic organization of various risk and protective factors and ideally are designed specifically to be scientifically testable and falsifiable.
#### Use
In the decade since the interpersonal theory was first posited, it has spurred scores of empirical inquiries into the etiologies of suicide ideation, attempts, and fatalities. Research testing the interpersonal theory has been conducted spanning diverse samples, such as psychiatric inpatients and outpatients ([Monteith et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R140)), prison inmates (Mandracchia & [Smith, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R132)), undergraduates (Hagan, [Podlogar, Chu, & Joiner, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R84)), sexual minorities ([Silva et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R188)), military service members ([Bryan et al., 2010](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R24)), physicians ([Fink-Miller, 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R69)), firefighters ([Chu, Buchman-Schmitt, Hom, Stanley, & Joiner, 2016](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R42)), and older adults ([Cukrowicz et al., 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R54)). Moreover, research on the theory has been conducted across samples derived from locations outside of the United States (U.S.), such as South Korea ([Chu et al., 2016b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R43)) and Australia ([Christiansen et al., 2014](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R39)). Components of the interpersonal theory have additionally led to advancements in the assessment of suicide risk ([Chu et al., 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R188); [Ribeiro, Bodell, Hames, Hagan, & Joiner, 2013](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R170)) and treatment recommendations ([Joiner & Van Orden, 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R111); [Joiner, Van Orden, Witte, & Rudd, 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/#R112); Stellrecht et al., 2005). Given the scope of research that has been conducted on the interpersonal theory to date, it is essential to synthesize the literature through a systematic review and meta-analyses to inform future directions in suicide prevention.
