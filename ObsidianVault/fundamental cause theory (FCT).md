Fundamental cause theory (theorized by Link and Phelan) seeks to explain why the link between socioeconomic status (SES) and health disparities continues to exist despite medical advancements and provides criteria for whether or not something is a cause of health inequality ([[Clouston '21#FCT Description]]):
1. It influences multiple disease outcomes
2. It affects disease outcomes through multiple risk factors
3. It involves access to preventative or responsive health resources
4. It persists over time despite the change in its mechanism ([[Clouston '21#FCT Description]])

SES meets these criteria (according to Link and Phelan) because:
* Limited health literacy
* Limited income (enables access to health care/insurance, healthy choices like nutritious food, gym membership, medications, health-promoting choices for jobs and residential environment)
* Power and prestige (enables time off work, political power, access to medical care, linked with mortality)
