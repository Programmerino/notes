Concurrent [[state machine composition|composition]] means multiple parts (often times [[actor]]s) of the [[CPS|system]] operate at the same time. The semantics of a concurrent [[state machine composition|composition]] of [[actor]]s is defined by a [[model of computation]].



There are many types/patterns of concurrent composition:
* [[synchronous composition|synchronous]]/[[asynchronous composition]]
* [[side-by-side composition]]
