* Continuous dynamics is used for [[classical mechanical problems in CPS|classical mechanical problems]] (e.g., moving mechanical parts, circuits, chemical processes, biological processes, etc.) which can easily be modeled with differential/integral equations based on continuous motion
* This is in contrast with [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS]], although they can be mixed with [[hybrid systems modeling]].
* Continuous [[CPS models]] relate input signals (e.g., force or torque) to output signals (e.g, [[classical mechanical problems in CPS|position]], [[orientation]], [[velocity]], [[rotational velocity]]) using differential/integral equations.
