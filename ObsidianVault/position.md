* Motion of physical objects can be represented with 6 degrees of freedom: x, y, z, roll (angle of rotation around x), yaw (angle of rotation around y), pitch (rotation around z). Each of these are functions of time, yielding distance/angle along/relative to an axis ([[continuous-time system|continuous-time signals]]). They can be combined into vector-valued functions as well.
		* From this, you can describe [[Newton's second law]], [[torque]], [[rotational velocity]], [[orientation]], etc.
* Position is the integral of [[velocity]], given by: $\begin{aligned} \mathbf{x}(t) & =\mathbf{x}(0)+\int_0^t \dot{\mathbf{x}}(\tau) d \tau \\ & =\mathbf{x}(0)+t \dot{\mathbf{x}}(0)+\frac{1}{M} \int_0^t \int_0^\tau \mathbf{F}(\alpha) d \alpha d \tau\end{aligned}$ where x(0) is the initial position.
