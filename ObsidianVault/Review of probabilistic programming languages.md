* Monad-bayes (Haskell monad)
	* Example [[RL HW 1 |here]].
	* Works well, everything as expected, no bugs so far
	* Documentation is sub-par
	* I can imagine that exact inference with `enumerate` may be very computationally expensive for large models
* PSI (PPL)
	* ...
* Hakaru (PPL)
	* Notes [[Hakaru notes|here]]
	* Supports exact, symbolic inference with Maple simplification
	* [Buggy](https://github.com/hakaru-dev/hakaru/issues/208), cannot be combined with normal programming.
