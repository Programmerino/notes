## Summary
Over an approximately 100-year time span, improvements in mortality came from reduced deaths from airborne diseases like respiratory tuberculosis, water-borne and food-borne disease, and somewhat from micro-organism-based disease. Non-infective conditions made up 3/4 of mortality changes during this period. Cardiovascular disease and cancer are rising, however. McKeown identifies potential causes as:
1. Changes in the character of diseases
2. Changes in the interaction between humans and disease
3. Reduction of exposure to infection
4. Improvements to nutrition
From analyzing each, McKeown concludes that nutrition improvements were the most impactful, and found that reduced exposure to infection also had an effect, although smaller. He finds that medical advances had an insignificant impact and that improvements in nutrition, hygiene, reproductive behavior, and its associated reduction in birth rate were important aspects. He postulates that future improvements will likely be made with changes to behavioral and environmental factors. Furthermore, he identifies advancements in health being made mostly in other areas of science than medicine, and argues this could be remedied by refocusing on health intelligence and epidemiology.

### Mortality link with nutrition
the usual trend of declining mortality during the twelve decades  
under study was the increase in the death rates for rheumatic heart  
disease, other cardiovascular diseases, and cancer.  
Four causes of the decline in mortality from infectious diseases  
are advanced and assessed. These are 1. changes in the character of  
the diseases, i.e., changes in the interaction between organism and  
host; 2. developments in immunization and therapy; 3. reduction of  
exposure to infection; and 4. improvements in nutrition. ==Examina-  
tion of the probable effect of each of these indicates that the changes  
in mortality may be attributed primarily to improved nutrition==.  
Reduced exposure to infection had some effect on mortality  
during the nineteenth century, as did immunization and therapy in  
the twentieth. There is little evidence of general changes in the  
character of the infectious diseases during the period under
