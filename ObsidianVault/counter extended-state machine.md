The [[counter state machine]] can more succinctly be represented as a [[extended-state machine]] since the number of [[state]]s which would need to be handled (such as the numbers up to the maximum int as suggested previously) can be quite large. As an [[extended-state machine|ESM]], you might have an initial [[state]] setting a variable $x$ to 0, and then two [[transition]]s on the counter can be constructed -- one for the [[guard]] $up \land\neg down\land x < MAX$ and one for the [[guard]] $down\land\neg up\land x > 0$, each corresponding to $x + 1$ and $c - 1$ and going back to the same [[state]]:

* Since there is one [[state]], one variable, and $M + 1$ possible values for $c$, the [[state space]] contains $M + 1$ states given the formula in [[extended-state machine]].
