There are several vague aspects of [[hierarchical composition]], such as what should happen if multiple [[guard]]s for [[transition]]s become true across composed [[finite-state machine]]s, or what order [[action]]s should be taken. The following are some commonly used semantics/strategies to clarify these:
* [[Lee and Tripakis semantics]] for the multiple-[[guard]] problem
* [[Sequential semantics]] for multiple [[action]]s
* [[Preemptive transitions]] to avoid a particular semantics system
