# A Verification of the Essential Thesis of the Transgender Movement
### Introduction
My primary goal is to answer the questions:
1. Has the social aspect of the movement improved outcomes for people identifying as transgender and/or people experiencing gender dysmorphia?
	1. Stigma
	2. ???
2. Has the movement unjustly encouraged more people to identify as transgender to a negative effect?
3. A brief overview of current literature surrounding gender-affirming treatments (including and not including adolescents) (List from [[BMJ '19#Gender dysphoria treatments are puberty suppression gender-affirming hormones and gender-affirming surgery]]):
	1. Puberty suppression
	2. Gender-affirming hormones
	3. Gender-affirming surgery
4. Is the evidence previously presented sufficient to guide modern-day decision making?

There is plenty more to be said about the transgender movement, although I argue that a proof of the claims above is sufficient to be generally supportive of the transgender movement and/or people.

Someone is "transgender" if one's gender identity or expression of their gender identity differs from the culturally-bound gender associated with one's assigned birth sex, and they are taking action (social, medical, etc.) to move away from this assigned birth sex. This appears to be a definition that is relatively unproblematic and matches most closely with the sources used in the rest of this article ([[Hughto '15#Transgender means mismatch between birth sex and expression]]).
### Has the social aspect of the movement improved outcomes for people identifying as transgender?
The central issue the transgender movement attempts to solve is the stigmatization and poor social outcomes associated with being transgender that were and are prevalent across the world. First, it should be noted that a systematic review has found that any groups which perceive external discrimination deal with worse health outcomes across the board ([[Pascoe '09#Perceived discrimination is directly linked to physical and mental health problems -- the best evidence proves]]). Given this, this question has a small burden of proof in that it only needs to demonstrate that the transgender movement has reduced stigma/discrimination towards transgender people
### Has the movement unjustly encouraged more people to identify as transgender to a negative effect?
The prevalence of adolescents identifying as transgender has risen exponentially since as soon as 2011, with birth-assigned females making up the majority of people seeking support for gender dysphoria[^3]:
