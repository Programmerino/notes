Structured dataflow is a technique for implementing conditional routing of [[token]]s in [[SDF]] without breaking verifiability guarantees (unlike [[DDF]]) through the use of the Conditional [[actor]] (see above). You will note that all the [[input]]s and [[output]]s retain a fixed amount of [[token]]s they can produce.

It is often accompanied by other constructs seen in [[imperative programming language]]s including for and do-while loops, case statements, and constrained recursion.
