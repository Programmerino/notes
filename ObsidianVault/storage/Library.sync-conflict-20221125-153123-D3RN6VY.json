  {"id":"'20","abstract":"The bombing of Dresden was a British-American aerial bombing attack on the city of Dresden, the capital of the German state of Saxony, during World War II. In four raids between 13 and 15 February 1945, 722 heavy bombers of the British Royal Air Force (RAF) and 527 of the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped more than 3,900 tons of high-explosive bombs and incendiary devices on the city. The bombing and the resulting firestorm destroyed more than 1,600 acres (6.5 km2) of the city centre. An estimated 22,700 to 25,000 people were killed. Three more USAAF air raids followed, two occurring on 2 March aimed at the city's railway marshalling yard and one smaller raid on 17 April aimed at industrial areas.\nImmediate German propaganda claims following the attacks and postwar discussions of whether the attacks were justified have led to the bombing becoming one of the moral causes célèbres of the war. A 1953 United States Air Force report defended the operation as the justified bombing of a strategic target, which they noted was a major rail transport and communication centre, housing 110 factories and 50,000 workers in support of the German war effort. \nSeveral researchers claim that not all of the communications infrastructure, such as the bridges, were targeted, nor were the extensive industrial areas outside the city centre. Critics of the bombing have asserted that Dresden was a cultural landmark while downplaying its strategic significance, and claim that the attacks were indiscriminate area bombing and not proportionate to the military gains. Some have claimed that the raid constituted a war crime. Some, mostly in the German far-right, refer to the bombing as a mass murder, calling it \"Dresden's Holocaust of bombs\".In the decades since the war, large variations in the claimed death toll have fuelled the controversy, though the numbers themselves are no longer a major point of contention among historians. In March 1945, the German government ordered its press to publish a falsified casualty figure of 200,000 for the Dresden raids, and death tolls as high as 500,000 have been claimed. The city authorities at the time estimated up to 25,000 victims, a figure that subsequent investigations supported, including a 2010 study commissioned by the city council. One of the main authors responsible for inflated figures being disseminated in the West was Holocaust denier David Irving, who subsequently announced that he had discovered that the documentation he had worked from had been forged, and the real figures supported the 25,000 number.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,12]]},"citation-key":"'20","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,10]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 988060167","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Bombing of Dresden in World War II","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bombing_of_Dresden_in_World_War_II&oldid=988060167"},

The conclusion of the ‘phase one’ trade deal, agreed to by the two countries in mid-January, provides an opportunity to assess what has been achieved so far. Trump’s efforts to change China’s behaviour are running up against the same limits faced by previous US administrations. Yet there is little evidence of a long-term strategy that reflects this reality. In the two decades leading up to Trump’s election, US presidents followed a broadly similar, largely bipartisan approach to engagement with China. The United States welcomed economic integration between the two countries, believing it would produce real economic gains for the United States and ultimately encourage China to move towards a more market-based economy.

This paper uses the Fiscal Analyzer (TFA) to assess how these policies, in unison, impact work incentives. TFA is a life-cycle, consumption-smoothing program that incorporates household borrowing constraints and all major federal and state fiscal policies. We use TFA in conjunction with the 2016 Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finances to calculate Americans’ remaining lifetime marginal net tax rates. Our findings are striking. One in four low-wage workers face marginal net tax rates above 70 percent, effectively locking them into poverty. Over half face remaining lifetime marginal net tax rates above 45 percent. The richest 1 percent also face a high median lifetime marginal tax rate – roughly 50 percent. Double taxation matters. The overall median lifetime marginal net tax rate is 43.2 percent compared with an overall current-year marginal net tax rate of 37.6 percent. We also find remarkable dispersion in both lifetime and current-year marginal net tax rates, particularly among the poor, and major differences in marginal and average net taxation across states, providing typical households a large incentive to relocate to another state.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Altig","given":"David"},{"family":"Auerbach","given":"Alan J"},{"family":"Kotlikoff","given":"Laurence J"},{"family":"Ilin","given":"Elias"},{"family":"Ye","given":"Victor"}],"citation-key":"Altig'20","DOI":"10.3386/w27164","genre":"Working Paper","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,5]]},"number":"27164","publisher":"National Bureau of Economic Research","source":"National Bureau of Economic Research","title":"Marginal Net Taxation of Americans’ Labor Supply","type":"report","URL":"http://www.nber.org/papers/w27164"},

  {"id":"Block'89","abstract":"The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which created the U.S. Sentencing Commission, required that the commisson consider prison capacity in drafting sentencing guidelines. As part of the commission's efforts to meet this requirement, we developed a computer simulation capable of projecting the impact of the commission's guidelines on future sentences and prison populations. According to our projections, “straight” probation sentences will be reduced significantly under the guidelines. However, reducing the use of probation will generate only modest demands on the prisons, and then mostly for community corrections phased in over the course of 5 years. We also project that, while average time served for violent offenses will increase substantially, average time served for most property crimes will remain largely the same. Finally, while we forecast that federal prison populations will grow markedly by the end of this century, this is more a result of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the career offender provision of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 than a result of the guidelines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Block","given":"Michael K."},{"family":"Rhodes","given":"William M."}],"citation-key":"Block'89","container-title":"Behavioral Sciences & the Law","DOI":"10.1002/bsl.2370070105","ISSN":"1099-0798","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1989]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 1989 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","note":"_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/bsl.2370070105","page":"51-71","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Forecasting the impact of the federal sentencing guidelines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/bsl.2370070105","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Bowsher'87","abstract":"The Department of Defense DOD has helped support drug law enforcement efforts for years, especially since the passage of the Posse Comitatus Amendment in 1981, which clarified the role of the military in assisting drug law enforcement agencies. DODS contributions to drug law enforcement efforts have included equipment loans, training for law enforcement agency officials, and radar coverage of major drug trafficking routes. Several provisions of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 authorized specific enhancements to the militarys support of drug law enforcement, such as the loan of four Navy surveillance aircraft to drug law enforcement agencies and the procurement of radar equipment to detect drug smuggling activities. Another provision of the act, section 3057, required that DOD prepare a list of assistance it could make available tofederal drug law enforcement agencies and a plan for promptly providing the assistance to these agencies. Section 3057 also required that DOD convene a conference of federal drug law enforcement agencies to reach agreement on the appropriate distribution of the assistance. We monitored DODs actions pursuant to these requirements of section 3057 and found that DOD generally complied with them.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Bowsher","given":"Charles A."}],"citation-key":"Bowsher'87","issued":{"date-parts":[[1987,12,1]]},"language":"en","publisher":"United States General Accounting Office Washington United States","section":"Technical Reports","source":"apps.dtic.mil","title":"Drug Law Enforcement: Military Assistance for Anti-Drug Agencies","title-short":"Drug Law Enforcement","type":"report","URL":"https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/AD1101877"},

  {"id":"Butler'18","abstract":"There has been a large increase in the number of children and adolescents who question conventional gender expectations and seek recognition and acceptance of their gender diversity, wishing to develop a body that is congruent with their gender feelings.1 Professionals may be unsure how best to provide supportive care, how to access the national Gender Identity Development Service (GIDS) for children and adolescents, or how to deal with a transgender young person presenting with another clinical problem unrelated to their gender transition. Faced with very distressed young people, they may feel under pressure to initiate physical intervention without consultation with psychosocial colleagues. It is important that all professionals are aware of the care pathway for transgender children that may be of relevance in a range of paediatric settings. The purpose of this practice review is to present an up-to-date perspective on the care of transgender children and adolescents to guide management and to enable the provision of a practical, evidence-based approach to their support.\n\nGender atypical behaviour is common among young children and can be part of general development. It is difficult to determine the exact incidence and prevalence of more intense and long-standing gender dysphoria (GD) in the UK and elsewhere as the total number of children and young people referred to the GIDS has risen exponentially since 20112 (figure 1). A striking feature of this increase is the large proportion of birth-registered females from 2011 onwards. This increase and the change in sex ratio is also seen in other countries.1 The reasons are not fully explicable and a number of questions arise. Is this increase due mostly to the greater tolerance of gender-diverse expression in westernised society? Is male status still regarded as preferable?

  {"id":"Chu'17","abstract":"Over the past decade, the interpersonal theory of suicide has contributed to substantial advances in the scientific and clinical understanding of suicide and related conditions. The interpersonal theory of suicide posits that suicidal desire emerges when individuals experience intractable feelings of perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness and that near-lethal or lethal suicidal behavior occurs in the presence of suicidal desire and capability for suicide. A growing number of studies have tested these posited pathways in various samples; however, these findings have yet to be evaluated meta-analytically. This paper aimed to: (1) conduct a systematic review of the unpublished and published, peer-reviewed literature examining the relationship between interpersonal theory constructs and suicidal thoughts and behaviors; (2) conduct meta-analyses testing the interpersonal theory hypotheses; and (3) evaluate the influence of various moderators on these relationships. Four electronic bibliographic databases were searched through the end of March 2016: PubMed, Medline, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Hypothesis-driven meta-analyses using random effects models were conducted using 122 distinct published and unpublished samples. Findings supported the interpersonal theory: the interaction between thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness was significantly associated with suicidal ideation; and the interaction between thwarted belongingness, perceived burdensomeness, and capability for suicide was significantly related to a greater number of prior suicide attempts. However, effect sizes for these interactions were modest. Alternative configurations of theory variables were similarly useful for predicting suicide risk as theory-consistent pathways. We conclude with limitations and recommendations for the interpersonal theory as a framework for understanding the suicidal spectrum.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chu","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Buchman-Schmitt","given":"Jennifer M."},{"family":"Stanley","given":"Ian H."},{"family":"Hom","given":"Melanie A."},{"family":"Tucker","given":"Raymond P."},{"family":"Hagan","given":"Christopher R."},{"family":"Rogers","given":"Megan L."},{"family":"Podlogar","given":"Matthew C."},{"family":"Chiurliza","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Ringer-Moberg","given":"Fallon B."},{"family":"Michaels","given":"Matthew S."},{"family":"Patros","given":"Connor"},{"family":"Joiner","given":"Thomas E."}],"citation-key":"Chu'17","container-title":"Psychological bulletin","container-title-short":"Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1037/bul0000123","ISSN":"0033-2909","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12]]},"page":"1313-1345","PMCID":"PMC5730496","PMID":"29072480","source":"PubMed Central","title":"The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of a Decade of Cross-National Research","title-short":"The Interpersonal Theory of Suicide","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730496/","volume":"143"},
  {"id":"Clouston'21","abstract":"Fundamental cause theory (FCT) was originally proposed to explain how socioeconomic inequalities in health emerged and persisted over time. The concept was that higher socioeconomic status helped some people to avoid risks and adopt protective strategies using flexible resources: knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial social connections. As a sociological theory, FCT addressed this issue by calling on social stratification, stigma, and racism as they affected medical treatments and health outcomes. The last comprehensive review was completed a decade ago. Since then, FCT has been tested, and new applications have extended central features.

  {"id":"Clouston'21a","abstract":"Fundamental cause theory (FCT) was originally proposed to explain how socioeconomic inequalities in health emerged and persisted over time. The concept was that higher socioeconomic status helped some people to avoid risks and adopt protective strategies using flexible resources: knowledge, money, power, prestige, and beneficial social connections. As a sociological theory, FCT addressed this issue by calling on social stratification, stigma, and racism as they affected medical treatments and health outcomes. The last comprehensive review was completed a decade ago. Since then, FCT has been tested, and new applications have extended central features. The current review consolidates key foci in the literature in order to guide future research in the field. Notable themes emerged around types of resources and their usage, approaches used to test the theory, and novel extensions.

For two and a half centuries since its description by Linnaeus, Electrophorus electricus has captivated humankind by its capacity to generate strong electric discharges. Despite the importance of Electrophorus in multiple fields of science, the possibility of additional species-level diversity in the genus, which could also reveal a hidden variety of substances and bioelectrogenic functions, has hitherto not been explored. Here, based on overwhelming patterns of genetic, morphological, and ecological data, we reject the hypothesis of a single species broadly distributed throughout Greater Amazonia. Our analyses readily identify three major lineages that diverged during the Miocene and Pliocene—two of which warrant recognition as new species. For one of the new species, we recorded a discharge of 860 V, well above 650 V previously cited for Electrophorus, making it the strongest living bioelectricity generator.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Santana","given":"C.

Also, Time 1 discrimination negatively predicted Time 2 concealment, but Time 1 expectations of rejection positively predicted Time 2 discrimination and concealment.

  {"id":"Education'20","abstract":"A comprehensive study guide offering in-depth explanation, essay, and test prep for selected works by Albert Camus, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1957. Titles in this study guide include The Stranger, The Myth of Sisyphus, The Rebel, The State of Siege, The Misunderstanding, The Just Assassins, Requiem for a Nun, The Possessed, The First Man, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, The Plague, Caligula, Summer, Betwixt and Between, Nuptials, Letters to a German Friend, and Summer.   As a notable French Algerian writer of philosophical literature in the early 1940s, Camus’s essays, novels, and playwrights focused on his moralist political stance and brought absurdism to light in the era of twentieth-century philosophy. Moreover, Camus is said to have written “on every subject that demanded a position,” which can be seen in his diverse literary works on ethics, humanity, and politics. This Bright Notes Study Guide explores the context and history of Camus’s classic work, helping students to thoroughly explore the reasons they have stood the literary test of time. Each Bright Notes Study Guide contains: - Introductions to the Author and the Work - Character Summaries - Plot Guides - Section and Chapter Overviews - Test Essay and Study Q&amp;As The Bright Notes Study Guide series offers an in-depth tour of more than 275 classic works of literature, exploring characters, critical commentary, historical background, plots, and themes.

  {"id":"Espinosa'00","abstract":"Objectives: To reduce errors made in the interpretation of radiographs in an emergency department.\nDesign: Longitudinal study.\nSetting: Hospital emergency department.\nInterventions: All staff reviewed all clinically significant discrepancies at monthly meetings. A file of clinically significant errors was created; the file was used for teaching. Later a team redesigned the process. A system was developed for interpreting radiographs that would be followed regardless of the day of the week or time of day. All standard radiographs were brought directly to the emergency physician for immediate interpretation. Radiologists reviewed the films within 12 hours as a quality control measure, and if a significant misinterpretation was found patients were asked to return.\nMain outcome measures: Reduction in number of clinically significant errors (such as missed fractures or foreign bodies) on radiographs read in the emergency department. Data on the error rate for radiologists and the effect of the recall procedure were not available so reliability modelling was used to assess the effect of these on overall safety.\nResults: After the initial improvements the rate of false negative errors fell from 3% (95% confidence interval 2.8% to 3.2%) to 1.2% (1.03% to 1.37%). After the processes were redesigned it fell further to 0.3% (0.26% to 0.34%). Reliability modelling showed that the number of potential adverse effects per 1000 cases fell from 19 before the improvements to 3 afterwards and unmitigated adverse effects fell from 2.2/1000 before to 0.16/1000 afterwards, assuming 95% success in calling patients back.\nConclusion: Systems of radiograph interpretation that optimise the skills of all clinicians involved and contain reliable processes for mitigating errors can reduce error rates substantially.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Espinosa","given":"James A."},{"family":"Nolan","given":"Thomas W."}],"citation-key":"Espinosa'00","container-title":"BMJ","container-title-short":"BMJ","DOI":"10.1136/bmj.320.7237.737","ISSN":"0959-8138, 1468-5833","issue":"7237","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000,3,18]]},"language":"en","license":"© 2000 BMJ Publishing Group Ltd.","page":"737-740","PMID":"10720354","source":"www.bmj.com","title":"Reducing errors made by emergency physicians in interpreting radiographs: longitudinal study","title-short":"Reducing errors made by emergency physicians in interpreting radiographs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.bmj.com/content/320/7237/737","volume":"320"},

Equally important was its success in attracting participants from a number of different disciplines -- scientific experts, national and EU administrators working in the drugs field, and members of the European Parliament.

  {"id":"Express'69","abstract":"During the past seven decades or so, shared economic and security interests have been the dominant factors in the Saudi-United States bilateral relationships. Successive US Administrations have defined the Saudi government as an important economic and security partner. Despite challenges, including the 1973 oil embargo and 9/11 terrorist attacks, the relationship between the two nations have been warm and expanding. While the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia needs US military protection, the US wants uninterrupted supply of Saudi oil.\nSaudi Arabia was the second largest trading partner of the US in the Middle East in 2019. The total US imports from Saudi Arabia amounted to $13.4 billion.  It is the second leading source of imported oil for the United States. On the other hand, the US usually exports weaponries, machinery, and vehicles to Saudi Arabia. Indeed, Saudi government is wholly dependent on continued US weapon supply and military advisory assistance.\nAs a long-term strategic partner, Saudi Arabia is the United States' largest foreign military sales (FMS) client, exceeding $100 billion.  Through the FMS, the US continues to support three important security establishments in Saudi Arabia i.e., the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Interior and the National Guard. Since the early 1950s, the US has been playing an important role in building military and civilian structures in Saudi Arabia. Presently, several US companies are functioning to ensure the success of Saudi ambitious Vision 2030 plan.\nThe US also continues to build up cultural and educational ties with Saudi Arabia. At present, more than 55,000 students from Saudi Arabia are pursuing higher studies in the US. Under the International Visitor Leadership Programme and other exchange packages, a lot of promising youths also visit the United States.\nTRACING THE PAST:  The US recognised Saudi Arabia in May 1931. The first encounter with Saudi Arabia commenced with the launching of Arabian-American Oil Company (Aramco) in 1933 under a Concession Agreement among Saudi Arabia, the Standard Oil Company of California (SOCAL) and the Texas Oil Company (Texaco). Diplomatic relations were established on February 4, 1940.\nCut off from trade and proceeds from the annual Hajj by World War II,    Saudi Arabia had turned to US for economic assistance. In October 1943, an agreement was concluded under which 5.167 million ounces of US Treasury silver would be lent to the Saudi government. The King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud, founder of Saudi Arabia had  promised to return the silver ounce for ounce within five years after the end of the war. \nPresident Franklin D Roosevelt and his administration had recognised that oil will be very vital for US in the future. While extending military and economic support to Saudi Arabia, he affirmed that  the defence of Saudi Arabia is vital to the defence of the United States. \nOn February 14, 1945, President Roosevelt had a historic meeting and dialogue with Saudi King Ibn Saud aboard a US Navy destroyer in the Suez Canal. Roosevelt had two main objectives: (a) resolving the Palestinian-Jewish problem, and (b) securing a productive post-war relationship with Saudi Arabia, including, crucially, access to its oil reserves. While Roosevelt and Ibn Saud agreed that the US would provide Saudi Arabia military and economic assistance in exchange for access to oil, they did not see eye to eye on the issue of homeland for the Europe's Holocaust survivors -- a commitment made by Roosevelt during his election campaign. As soon as Roosevelt raised the problem and their aspiration for a Jewish homeland in Palestine, the response from the King was immediate:  Give them and their descendants the choicest lands and homes of the Germans who had oppressed them. \nRoosevelt contended that few of them would desire to live in Germany. Unconvinced, the king said:  Make the enemy and the oppressor pay; that is how we Arabs wage war. Amends should be made by the criminal, not by the innocent bystander.  Roosevelt assured that he  would never do anything which might prove hostile to the Arabs and (that) the US Government would make no change in its basic policy in Palestine without full and prior consultation with both Jews and Arabs. \nThus, the foundations of an economic and security relationship between the two countries established 75 years ago by Roosevelt and Ibn Saud has not only endured to this day, but also flourished over the years.\nBURGEONING RELATIONSHIP IN THE TRUMP-SALMAN ERA: In the past, a critic of Saudi Arabia, President Donald Trump these days has engaged himself in bolstering bilateral relations. In fact, defending Saudi Arabia openly remains a consistent foreign policy of President Trump. This is confirmed by the fact that most of the bills vetoed by him  were related to Congressional attempts to censure the Kingdom. To illustrate, in April 2019, Trump vetoed a bipartisan resolution of Congress that invoked its war power authority and called to end US involvement in the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen's civil war. Again in July, he vetoed Congressional resolution intended to prevent him from selling billions of dollars of armaments to the Saudis.\nNot surprisingly, Trump undertook his first international trip as President to Riyadh. He unveiled there a  counter-terrorism  centre controlled by the Saudi government and assured continuation of defence sales and cooperation. In March 2017, and again in March 2018, President Trump received Crown Prince, Mohammed bin Salman in the Oval Office at White House reiterating his commitment to Saudi Arabia. He demonstrated pictures of military aircrafts and equipment valued $12.5 billion which the US decided to sell to Saudi Arabia.\nTrump also supported the Crown Prince Salman's Qatar embargo, because of its close camaraderie with Iran. He regularly recognises the kingdom as the most important buyer of US weaponries and a valuable partner to the mutual goal of confronting Iran. The murder of Saudi dissident, The Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate was also overlooked by Trump.\nAlso worth noting, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner has cultivated personal relationship with the Saudi royal family and in particular with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\nThe US and Saudi Arabia have common interest in preserving stability, security, and the wealth of the Gulf region. President Trump, like his predecessors, has continuously placed top priority on the US-Saudi economic and security relations. In response to Saudi needs, in September 2019, Trump approved additional military personnel and resources to reinforce Saudi Arabia's air and missile defence system and to deal with any future attacks on its oil facilities and other infrastructure.\nThe Saudi government had agreed to fund all deployment including operational costs. Currently, an estimated 2,500 US military personnel are stationed in the country. Notably, the Kingdom also funded billions of dollars to offset huge costs of US-led coalition forces to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait in 1991.\nThe 75th anniversary of  enduring relationship  between the United States and Saudi Arabia was celebrated at a ceremony in Jeddah on February 16, 2020. Based on mutual interests and growing business ties, undoubtedly, the US-Saudi Arabia relation is at its historical best right now.\nAnalyst Oubai Shabandar, a former Pentagon official has aptly commented that the two nations have succeeded to challenge a number of impediments in their bilateral relations in the past since  it is a relationship that has been anchored on common security interests and personal bonds between leaders. \nHowever, critics such as Edward Luce defined the rapidly increasing relationship with Riyadh as  the decay of the US-led order  and observed, Trump's course of foreign relations is a  blend of family and money and a weakness for flattery. \nDr Kamal Uddin Ahmed is a former Professor and Chairman of Department of Political Science at the University of Dhaka.\nKamal112au@yahoo.com","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Express","given":"The Financial"}],"citation-key":"Express'69","container-title":"The Financial Express","issued":{"date-parts":[[1969,12,31]]},"language":"en","source":"thefinancialexpress.com.bd","title":"Washington-Riyadh relations blooming","type":"webpage","URL":"https://thefinancialexpress.com.bd/views/opinions/washington-riyadh-relations-blooming-1583158672"},

  {"id":"Exum'19","abstract":"Criminal justice reform has had a firm place in news headlines for more than a decade. Reform has mainly been sought through two approaches: consensus through ballot initiative or legislative compromise. But these modes of reform share a fundamental failure: both often lack a clear articulation of the purpose of criminal sentencing. In other words, “What’s the point?” Without an agreement on the underlying purpose of criminal punishment, neither method of pursuing changes in the criminal justice system can ever produce meaningful, long-standing reform.Our usual way of understanding criminal justice reform is through legislative compromise. The moves from the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 to the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 to the First Step Act of 2018 were the result of this slow legislative mechanism. However, the resulting sentencing changes were not due to an effort to study the effects of drug sentencing or to any work toward agreement about what purpose Congress was actually trying to fulfill through drug sentencing. The same problem exists when it comes to consensus reform through ballot initiative – a move that has taken place in many areas of the country—from the passing of recreational marijuana laws in places like Michigan to the attempt to pass sweeping drug sentencing reform through Ohio’s Ballot Issue. When examined, these efforts at reform consensus show that agreement on the need for reform does not show agreement on the purpose of reform. This lack of true, deep consensus can ultimately defeat efforts at large-scale reform through consensus.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Exum","given":"Jelani Jefferson"}],"citation-key":"Exum'19","container-title":"Federal Sentencing Reporter","container-title-short":"Federal Sentencing Reporter","DOI":"10.1525/fsr.2019.32.2.65","ISSN":"1053-9867","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,1]]},"language":"en","page":"65-69","publisher":"University of California Press","source":"online.ucpress.edu","title":"What’s the Point?

  {"id":"Fischer'11","abstract":"Providing ad hoc solutions for positioning and tracking of emergency response teams is an important and safety-critical challenge. Although solutions based on inertial sensing systems are promising, they are subject to drift. We address the problem of positional drift by having the responders themselves deploy sensor nodes capable of sensing range and angle-of-arrival, as they progress into an unknown environment. Our research focuses on a sensor network approach that does not rely on preexisting infrastructure. This chapter targets two important aspects of such a solution: how to locate the deployed static sensor nodes, and how to track the responders by using a combination of ultrasound and inertial measurements. The main contributions of this chapter are: (i) a characterization of the errors encountered in inertial-based pedestrian dead-reckoning as well as ultrasound range and bearing measurements in a mobile setting, (ii) the formulation of an extended Kalman filter for simultaneously locating sensor nodes and tracking a pedestrian using a combination of ultrasound range/bearing measurements and inertial measurements, and (iii) the validation of the presented algorithms using data collected from real deployments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Fischer","given":"Carl"},{"family":"Muthukrishnan","given":"Kavitha"},{"family":"Hazas","given":"Mike"}],"citation-key":"Fischer'11","container-title":"Advances in Computers","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-385514-5.00003-3","editor":[{"family":"Zelkowitz","given":"Marvin V."}],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"103-160","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 3 - SLAM for Pedestrians and Ultrasonic Landmarks in Emergency Response Scenarios","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123855145000033","volume":"81"},

  {"id":"Gaylor'03","abstract":"The next generation reusable launch vehicle will operate in flve ∞ight phases: ascent, on-orbit, proximity operations, re-entry and landing. Navigation during each of these ∞ight phases presents unique challenges. The Space Shuttle addresses these challenges by the use of a number of navigation sensors. However, an integrated GPS/INS navigation system may be able to meet the navigation requirements of all ∞ight phases. Integrated GPS/INS systems have been built and demonstrated for the ascent, re-entry and landing phases and their performance is known. However, the same cannot be said for integrated GPS/INS systems for the on-orbit and proximity operations ∞ight phases. Therefore, this research examines the performance of GPS/INS navigation during a rendezvous with the ISS. Error models for INS and GPS navigation sensors operating in the vicinity of the ISS have been developed. The GPS error model includes the efiects of GPS signal blockage and multipath near the ISS. These error models have been used to develop an integrated GPS/INS extended Kalman fllter. A simulation of the fllter has been developed and the flrst test case shows position errors of less than 1 meter and velocity errors of less than 0.02 m/s in each axis. The second test case shows the position errors grow to approximately 47.5 meters and the velocity errors grow to 0.13 m/s during a ten minute GPS outage. Finally, the third test case shows that the GPS/INS EKF performance is not signiflcantly degraded by GPS signal blockage due to the ISS during a simulated rendezvous with the ISS.","author":[{"family":"Gaylor","given":"David"},{"family":"Lightsey","given":"Glenn"}],"citation-key":"Gaylor'03","DOI":"10.2514/6.2003-5445","issued":{"date-parts":[[2003,8,11]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"GPS/INS Kalman Filter Design for Spacecraft Operating in the Proximity of the International Space Station","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Grewal'07","abstract":"An updated guide to GNSS and INS, and solutions to real-world GPS/INS problems with Kalman filtering Written by recognized authorities in the field, this second edition of a landmark work provides engineers, computer scientists, and others with a working familiarity with the theory and contemporary applications of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Inertial Navigational Systems (INS), and Kalman filters. Throughout, the focus is on solving real-world problems, with an emphasis on the effective use of state-of-the-art integration techniques for those systems, especially the application of Kalman filtering. To that end, the authors explore the various subtleties, common failures, and inherent limitations of the theory as it applies to real-world situations, and provide numerous detailed application examples and practice problems, including GNSS-aided INS, modeling of gyros and accelerometers, and SBAS and GBAS. Drawing upon their many years of experience with GNSS, INS, and the Kalman filter, the authors present numerous design and implementation techniques not found in other professional references. This Second Edition has been updated to include:  GNSS signal integrity with SBAS Mitigation of multipath, including results Ionospheric delay estimation with Kalman filters New MATLAB programs for satellite position determination using almanac and ephemeris data and ionospheric delay calculations from single and dual frequency data New algorithms for GEO with L1 /L5 frequencies and clock steering Implementation of mechanization equations in numerically stable algorithms  To enhance comprehension of the subjects covered, the authors have included software in MATLAB, demonstrating the working of the GNSS, INS, and filter algorithms. In addition to showing the Kalman filter in action, the software also demonstrates various practical aspects of finite word length arithmetic and the need for alternative algorithms to preserve result accuracy.","author":[{"family":"Grewal","given":"Mohinder S."},{"family":"Weill","given":"Lawrence R."},{"family":"Andrews","given":"Angus P."}],"citation-key":"Grewal'07","ISBN":"978-0-470-09971-1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2007,3,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"553","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons","source":"Google Books","title":"Global Positioning Systems, Inertial Navigation, and Integration","type":"book"},

  {"id":"He'10","abstract":"After the Cold War, US strategists have suggested four strategies for the hegemon: hegemonic dominion, selective engagement, offshore balancing, and multilateralism. Rather than debating which strategy is the best for the US at all times, this article focuses on examining which policy is more likely to be chosen by the hegemon – the US – under different strategic conditions. Through a neoclassical realist argument – the power-perception hegemonic model, I argue that US foreign policy depends on how US policymakers perceive US hegemonic status in the international system. Under rising and stable hegemony, selective engagement and hegemonic dominion are two possible power-maximisation strategies given the weak security constraints from the system. Under declining hegemony, offshore balancing and multilateralism are more likely to be chosen by US policymakers to pursue security because of a resumed security imperative from anarchy. US policy toward Asia after the Cold War is a case study to test the validity of the power-perception hegemonic model. I conclude that US policymakers should prepare for life after Pax-Americana, and early implementation of offshore balancing and multilateralism may facilitate the soft-landing of declining US hegemony.","author":[{"family":"He","given":"Kai"}],"citation-key":"He'10","container-title":"Review of International Studies","container-title-short":"Review of International Studies","DOI":"10.1017/S0260210510000227","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,10,1]]},"page":"1121-1143","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The hegemon's choice between power and security: Explaining US policy toward Asia after the Cold War","title-short":"The hegemon's choice between power and security","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},

This paper presents the design and implementation of three key features of Futhark that seek a suitable middle ground with imperative approaches. First, in order to express efficient code inside the parallel constructs, we introduce a simple type system for in-place updates that ensures referential transparency and supports equational reasoning. Second, we furnish Futhark with parallel operators capable of expressing efficient strength-reduced code, along with their fusion rules. Third, we present a flattening transformation aimed at enhancing the degree of parallelism that (i) builds on loop interchange and distribution but uses higher-order reasoning rather than array-dependence analysis, and (ii) still allows further locality-of-reference optimisations. Finally, an evaluation on 16 benchmarks demonstrates the impact of the language and compiler features and shows application-level performance competitive with hand-written GPU code.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Henriksen","given":"Troels"},{"family":"Serup","given":"Niels G.

  {"id":"James'13","abstract":"Objectives Based on 1984 data developed from reviews of medical records of patients treated in New York hospitals, the Institute of Medicine estimated that up to 98,000 Americans die each year from medical errors. The basis of this estimate is nearly 3 decades old; herein, an updated estimate is developed from modern studies published from 2008 to 2011.\n        Methods A literature review identified 4 limited studies that used primarily the Global Trigger Tool to flag specific evidence in medical records, such as medication stop orders or abnormal laboratory results, which point to an adverse event that may have harmed a patient. Ultimately, a physician must concur on the findings of an adverse event and then classify the severity of patient harm.\n        Results Using a weighted average of the 4 studies, a lower limit of 210,000 deaths per year was associated with preventable harm in hospitals. Given limitations in the search capability of the Global Trigger Tool and the incompleteness of medical records on which the Tool depends, the true number of premature deaths associated with preventable harm to patients was estimated at more than 400,000 per year. Serious harm seems to be 10- to 20-fold more common than lethal harm.\n        Conclusions The epidemic of patient harm in hospitals must be taken more seriously if it is to be curtailed. Fully engaging patients and their advocates during hospital care, systematically seeking the patients’ voice in identifying harms, transparent accountability for harm, and intentional correction of root causes of harm will be necessary to accomplish this goal.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2018,7,2]]},"author":[{"family":"James","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"James'13","container-title":"Journal of Patient Safety","DOI":"10.1097/PTS.0b013e3182948a69","ISSN":"1549-8417","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,9]]},"language":"en-US","page":"122","source":"journals.lww.com","title":"A New, Evidence-based Estimate of Patient Harms Associated with Hospital Care","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.lww.com/journalpatientsafety/Fulltext/2013/09000/A_New,_Evidence_based_Estimate_of_Patient_Harms.2.aspx","volume":"9"},

The articles approach drug policy from new angles, focusing in particular on the history and consequences of drug policy in practice. How can we understand and explain the increasingly complex puzzle that we call drug policy? The authors explore in different ways how drug policy has spread into new areas of society, how new players are engaged in drug policy, and what consequences this has for drug users, citizens, or society in general. Taking a point of departure in drug policy as a way of regulating drugs - including control, treatment, prevention and harm reduction - the book shows how drug policy has become increasingly diverse and evident at many levels of society. A very wide range of drug policies are implemented in contemporary societies - not only by governments, but also by local communities, organisations, public institutions, private enterprises, sports clubs etc. Using examples from both Denmark and the USA, drug policy is analysed on an international, national and local level. This book will be of great value to advanced undergraduate and graduate students with an interest in drug policy, as well as to academics, practitioners and policy makers in the drug policy field.","author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Eric"}],"citation-key":"Jensen'08","container-title":"Drug Wars in the United States: The Construction of Problematic Conditions","ISBN":"978-87-7934-770-0","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,12,30]]},"language":"en","publisher":"ISD LLC","source":"Google Books","title":"Drug Wars in the United States: The Construction of Problematic Conditions","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"Jensen'91","abstract":"The 1986 War on Drugs is analyzed from the perspective of the constructionist approach to social problems. Using the model developed by Mauss, and relying on self-report data on drug use, we argue that the objective conditions of drug use cannot explain why drugs became an issue immediately prior to the 1986 elections. Instead, explanations for the rise of drugs as a social problem are to be found primarily in the political realm. Politicians looking for a “safe” election issue took advantage of a general public concern about drug abuse by promoting drugs as a social problem. Theoretical implications for Mauss's approach are explored in a concluding section.

  {"id":"Joiner'05","abstract":"In the wake of a suicide, the most troubling questions are invariably the most difficult to answer: How could we have known? What could we have done? And always, unremittingly: Why? Written by a clinical psychologist whose own life has been touched by suicide, this book offers the clearest account ever given of why some people choose to die. Drawing on extensive clinical and epidemiological evidence, as well as personal experience, Thomas Joiner brings a comprehensive understanding to seemingly incomprehensible behavior. Among the many people who have considered, attempted, or died by suicide, he finds three factors that mark those most at risk of death: the feeling of being a burden on loved ones; the sense of isolation; and, chillingly, the learned ability to hurt oneself. Joiner tests his theory against diverse facts taken from clinical anecdotes, history, literature, popular culture, anthropology, epidemiology, genetics, and neurobiology--facts about suicide rates among men and women; white and African-American men; anorexics, athletes, prostitutes, and physicians; members of cults, sports fans, and citizens of nations in crisis. The result is the most coherent and persuasive explanation ever given of why and how people overcome life's strongest instinct, self-preservation. Joiner's is a work that makes sense of the bewildering array of statistics and stories surrounding suicidal behavior; at the same time, it offers insight, guidance, and essential information to anyone whose life has been affected by suicide.

  {"id":"Kilkenny'09","abstract":"For scientific, ethical and economic reasons, experiments involving animals should be appropriately designed, correctly analysed and transparently reported. This increases the scientific validity of the results, and maximises the knowledge gained from each experiment. A minimum amount of relevant information must be included in scientific publications to ensure that the methods and results of a study can be reviewed, analysed and repeated. Omitting essential information can raise scientific and ethical concerns. We report the findings of a systematic survey of reporting, experimental design and statistical analysis in published biomedical research using laboratory animals. Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting research on live rats, mice and non-human primates carried out in UK and US publicly funded research establishments. Detailed information was collected from 271 publications, about the objective or hypothesis of the study, the number, sex, age and/or weight of animals used, and experimental and statistical methods. Only 59% of the studies stated the hypothesis or objective of the study and the number and characteristics of the animals used. Appropriate and efficient experimental design is a critical component of high-quality science. Most of the papers surveyed did not use randomisation (87%) or blinding (86%), to reduce bias in animal selection and outcome assessment. Only 70% of the publications that used statistical methods described their methods and presented the results with a measure of error or variability. This survey has identified a number of issues that need to be addressed in order to improve experimental design and reporting in publications describing research using animals. Scientific publication is a powerful and important source of information; the authors of scientific publications therefore have a responsibility to describe their methods and results comprehensively, accurately and transparently, and peer reviewers and journal editors share the responsibility to ensure that published studies fulfil these criteria.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Kilkenny","given":"Carol"},{"family":"Parsons","given":"Nick"},{"family":"Kadyszewski","given":"Ed"},{"family":"Festing","given":"Michael F.

The text then ponders on quasi-moment functions in the theory of random processes and correlation functions in the theory of the Brownian motion generalization of the Fokker-Planck equation.The manuscript elaborates on the correlation functions of random sequences of rectangular pulses; method of determining the envelope of quasi-harmonic fluctuations; and the problem of measuring electrical fluctuations with the aid of thermoelectric devices.

However, signals from GPS satellites are affected by the external environment, which may reduce the positioning accuracy of GPS. More seriously, the GPS receiver may receive spoofing signals, resulting in positioning errors in the integrated navigation. Therefore, an anti-spoofing integrated navigation method is proposed in this paper. The error propagation characteristics of inertial navigation and the prediction estimation value in Kalman filter are used to detect the spoofing. After spoofing detection, credible GPS positioning results are used for Kalman filter as measurements. The method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the accuracy and robustness of integrated navigation. At the same time, it does not need to modify the existing GPS equipment or additional equipment.

  {"id":"M.D'18","abstract":"Novel in its approach and unique in its scope, Black Mental Health: Patients, Providers, and Systems examines the role of African Americans within American psychiatric health care from distinct but interconnected perspectives. The experiences of both black patients and the black mental health professionals who serve them are analyzed against the backdrop of the cultural, societal, and professional forces that have shaped their place in this specialized health care arena.The volume opens with the singular, first-person accounts of five senior black psychiatrists -- including Dr. Altha J. Stewart, president of the American Psychiatric Association -- who describe their individual journeys to the top of their field, not shying away from discussing the racism and discrimination that have challenged their paths to leadership.The book's second part focuses on the complexities of and opportunities for delivering mental health care to various subsets of the African American population, including children, women, elderly patients, and LGBTQ individuals. System design strategies, biological therapies, and church-based mental health promotion initiatives are all considered as methods for reducing racial and ethnic disparities in access to effective treatment.Part III examines the training of black mental health professionals and their representation in psychiatry, particularly in the face of discrimination and implicit bias. A chapter on historically black colleges and universities discusses the importance of their role in the delivery of psychiatric services and research development for African Americans. The fourth part builds on this discussion, addressing research that is relevant to the care of the black population.A concluding chapter highlights the key themes that emerged from each of the previous four parts, providing a holistic view of the place of black patients and providers in American psychiatry.With its blend of scholarship, clinical insight, and training analysis, Black Mental Health is compulsory reading both for trainees -- as care delivery to minority groups is of ever greater importance -- and practicing clinicians, who will glean useful information from the chapters on research advances and treatment modalities. Additionally, policy makers, educators, and historians, among others, will gain a better understanding of the challenges and necessity of developing integrated approaches to the care of nondominant groups.","author":[{"family":"M.D","given":"Ezra E.

  {"id":"Marmot'97a","abstract":"Life expectancy has always differed according to status in society, with a higher mortality among those of lower social status. Although cancer and cardiovascular diseases are more common as causes of death in rich than in poor societies, in industrialized countries the major causes of death are more common in those of lower social status. In this chapter, the magnitude of socioeconomic differences in health is examined using different measures of socioeconomic status, and methodological issues relating to these measures are discussed. Much of the discussion about social inequalities in health has been focused on the health disadvantage of those of lowest socioeconomic status. However, data from the Whitehall studies show that the social gradient in morbidity and mortality exists across employment grades in British civil servants, none of whom is poor by comparison with people in developing countries, suggesting that there are factors that operate across the whole of society. A number of potential explanations are considered here. The magnitude of socioeconomic differences in health varies between societies, and over time within societies. This suggests that identification of factors that influence socioeconomic status and health, and the pathways by which they operate, is an important public health task that could lay the basis for a reduction in inequalities in health.","author":[{"family":"Marmot","given":"M"},{"family":"Feeney","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"Marmot'97a","container-title":"IARC scientific publications","container-title-short":"IARC Sci Publ","ISSN":"0300-5038","issue":"138","issued":{"date-parts":[[1997,1,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"207-228","PMID":"9353666","source":"Europe PMC","title":"General explanations for social inequalities in health","type":"article-journal"},

  {"id":"Pacheco'","abstract":"The study of racial disparity in the criminal justice system has been widely recognized as a complex and sensitive issue that has indelibly influenced sentencing outcomes for Black men. With the passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, new Federal mandatory minimum guidelines recognized the 100:1 crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity which set into motion an era of aggressive policies. This research analyzes the effects of mandatory minimum sentencing laws embedded in the ADAA of 1986, while establishing the inconsistencies with aggressive policing and the ramifications associated with racial discrimination. Critical Race Theory is used as an analytic, explanatory, and conceptual instrument in the study, while providing a necessary understanding of the framework used in identifying and examining the differences between the sentencing disparity in relation to socioeconomic status and race. The analysis of this policy introduces previous and current research to examine the power structures and systemic oppression that perpetuate racial inequities in order to identify and develop strategies for action and change. The preponderance of evidence suggests that the association of race and sentencing outcomes continues to operate through policies and practices inundated within social systems, structures, and institutions that systematically reflect and produce racial inequalities.","author":[{"family":"Pacheco","given":"Zahida"}],"citation-key":"Pacheco'","language":"en_US","publisher":"California State University, Northridge","title":"The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986","type":"webpage"},

First, we discuss the concept of health care error and describe two approaches to analyze error proliferation and causation. Next, by applying transdisciplinary evidence and knowledge to health care, we detail the attributes fundamental to constructing safer health care systems as embedded components within the complex adaptive environment. Then, the Health Care Error Proliferation Model explains the sequence of events typically leading to adverse outcomes, emphasizing the role that organizational and external cultures contribute to error identification, prevention, mitigation, and defense construction. Subsequently, we discuss the critical contribution health care leaders can make to address error as they strive to position their institution as a high reliability organization (HRO). Finally, we conclude that the future of patient safety depends on health care leaders adopting a system philosophy of error management, investigation, mitigation, and prevention. This change is accomplished when leaders apply the basic organizational accident and health care safety principles within their respective organizations.","author":[{"family":"Palmieri","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Delucia","given":"Patricia"},{"family":"Peterson","given":"Lori"},{"family":"Ott","given":"Tammy"},{"family":"Green","given":"Alexia"}],"citation-key":"Palmieri'08","container-title":"Advances in Health Care Management","DOI":"10.1016/S1474-8231(08)07003-1","ISSN":"978-1-84663-954-8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2008,7,25]]},"page":"33-68","source":"ResearchGate","title":"The anatomy and physiology of error in adverse health care events","type":"article-journal","volume":"7"},

  {"id":"Pascoe'09","abstract":"Perceived discrimination has been studied with regard to its impact on several types of health effects. This meta-analysis provides a comprehensive account of the relationships between multiple forms of perceived discrimination and both mental and physical health outcomes. In addition, this meta-analysis examines potential mechanisms by which perceiving discrimination may affect health, including through psychological and physiological stress responses and health behaviors. Analysis of 134 samples suggests that when weighting each study’s contribution by sample size, perceived discrimination has a significant negative effect on both mental and physical health. Perceived discrimination also produces significantly heightened stress responses and is related to participation in unhealthy and nonparticipation in healthy behaviors. These findings suggest potential pathways linking perceived discrimination to negative health outcomes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Pascoe","given":"Elizabeth A."},{"family":"Richman","given":"Laura Smart"}],"citation-key":"Pascoe'09","container-title":"Psychological bulletin","container-title-short":"Psychol Bull","DOI":"10.1037/a0016059","ISSN":"0033-2909","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,7]]},"page":"531-554","PMCID":"PMC2747726","PMID":"19586161","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Perceived Discrimination and Health: A Meta-Analytic Review","title-short":"Perceived Discrimination and Health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747726/","volume":"135"},

  {"id":"Qi'19","abstract":"Freeway entrance ramp has intensive vehicle merging activities that lead to delay and potentially high risk of collision between merging and freeway vehicles, especially for the ramps with a high percentage of heavy truck volume. Sufficient length of acceleration lane is critical for the traffic operations at the ramp merging sections. Currently, most DOTs employ the guidelines provided in the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) Green Book, “A Policy on Geometric Design of Highways and Streets” (AASHTO 2011). However, AASHTO’s acceleration lane length design guideline was developed based on passenger cars and hasn’t been updated for years since 1965. In addition, AASHTO other design guidelines and previous studies mainly considered the speed differential between the on-ramp and freeway vehicles on determining freeway acceleration lane length. Only a few of them considered traffic volume, and even less gave special considerations on the heavy trucks that need more time to accelerate and find larger gaps to merge. This research developed an analytical model for estimating the required freeway acceleration lane lengths for both heavy trucks and passenger cars. The model considers both the acceleration and gap searching needs of the merging vehicles. As a result, it can take account of the impacts of the freeway traffic volume into the estimation of the required acceleration lane length. A case study was conducted in Houston, TX to demonstrate the model application. Finally, this research provides a chart and a lookup table for estimating required acceleration lane lengths for both heavy trucks and passenger cars under different traffic volume conditions for different combinations of the freeway and entrance ramp design speeds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Qi","given":"Yi"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qun"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Shaojie"},{"family":"Qu","given":"Wenrui"},{"family":"Li","given":"Juan"},{"literal":"University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Starting from a functional core language with explicit control-flow, Perceus emits precise reference counting instructions such that (cycle-free) programs are garbage free, where only live references are retained. This enables further optimizations, like reuse analysis that allows for guaranteed in-place updates at runtime. This in turn enables a novel programming paradigm that we call functional but in-place (FBIP). Much like tail-call optimization enables writing loops with regular function calls, reuse analysis enables writing in-place mutating algorithms in a purely functional way. We give a novel formalization of reference counting in a linear resource calculus, and prove that Perceus is sound and garbage free. We show evidence that Perceus, as implemented in Koka, has good performance and is competitive with other state-of-the-art memory collectors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Reinking","given":"Alex"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Ningning"},{"family":"Moura","given":"Leonardo","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Leijen","given":"Daan"}],"citation-key":"Reinking'21","container-title":"Proceedings of the 42nd ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","DOI":"10.1145/3453483.3454032","event-place":"Virtual Canada","event-title":"PLDI '21: 42nd ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation","ISBN":"978-1-4503-8391-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,19]]},"language":"en","page":"96-111","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"Virtual Canada","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Perceus: garbage free reference counting with reuse","title-short":"Perceus","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3453483.3454032"},

After\nreviewing government documents and scholarly literature that address the policy, a\nmodified version of David Gil’s 1992 framework was used to conduct the analysis.\nSignificant findings include the misalignment between the policy’s objectives and\nthe factual American condition regarding drugs and drug-related crime. Since\nimplementation, people and communities of color have been disproportionately\ndisadvantaged by this policy. New social problems, such as prison overcrowding, have\nresulted from lengthy prison sentences.\nFrom this analysis, social workers can learn the importance of educating the\npublic about drug use and related systemic issues. Social workers can use this\ninformation to advocate for relevant and effective policies to respond to problematic drug\nuse in America from a public health, rather than criminal justice, perspective.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Sandoval","given":"Laura"}],"citation-key":"Sandoval'13","event-place":"La Mirada, California","issued":{"date-parts":[[2013,5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"80","publisher":"Biola University","publisher-place":"La Mirada, California","source":"Zotero","title":"THE ANTI-DRUG ABUSE ACT OF 1986: A POLICY ANALYSIS","type":"thesis"},

We analyzed valid and reliable survey instruments from 284 people with Down syndrome on the mailing lists of six non-profit Down syndrome organizations around the country. Among those surveyed, nearly 99% of people with Down syndrome indicated that they were happy with their lives; 97% liked who they are; and 96% liked how they look. Nearly 99% people with Down syndrome expressed love for their families, and 97% liked their brothers and sisters. While 86% of people with Down syndrome felt they could make friends easily, those with difficulties mostly had isolating living situations. A small percentage expressed sadness about their life. In our qualitative analysis, people with Down syndrome encouraged parents to love their babies with Down syndrome, mentioning that their own lives were good. They further encouraged healthcare professionals to value them, emphasizing that they share similar hopes and dreams as people without Down syndrome. Overall, the overwhelming majority of people with Down syndrome surveyed indicate they live happy and fulfilling lives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Skotko","given":"Brian G."},{"family":"Levine","given":"Susan P."},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"Skotko'11","container-title":"American journal of medical genetics.

  {"id":"Stolz'92","abstract":"Passing anti-drug/anti-crime legislation seems to have become an election year tradition of the U.S. Congress. On the eve of adjournment, the 99th and 100th Congresses enacted omnibus anti-drug legislation, which created new programs, significantly increased federal funding for anti-drug programs, and instituted additional criminal sanctions for drug-related crimes. To explain this phenomenon, the symbolic aspects-those directed at the public-of the congressional policy-making process which led to the enactment of the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988 are examined. Specifically, the legislation is analyzed in terms of three symbolic components of criminal law-reassurance/threat, moral education, and providing a model for the states. This article describes how the initiation, enactment, and specific provisions of recent anti-drug and anti-crime legislation were affected by Congress’ need to: 1) reassure the public that the nation's drug problem was under control, 2) communicate an anti-Drug use message to the law-abiding and 3) provide model laws and programs for the states. The findings presented raise a number of issues and questions regarding the content and formulation of Drug and criminal justice policy, the congressional policy-making process, in general, and Congress's ability to respond effectively to national problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Stolz","given":"Barbara Ann"}],"citation-key":"Stolz'92","container-title":"Journal of Crime and Justice","DOI":"10.1080/0735648X.1992.9721455","ISSN":"0735-648X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[1992,1,1]]},"note":"_eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.1992.9721455","page":"119-136","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Congress and the War on Drugs: An Exercise in Symbolic Politics","title-short":"Congress and the War on Drugs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648X.1992.9721455","volume":"15"},

  {"id":"Testa'17","abstract":"Research has revealed alarmingly high rates of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts among transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) people. This study aims to analyze the role of factors from the gender minority stress and resilience (GMSR) model (Testa, Habarth, Peta, Balsam, & Bockting, 2015), the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPTS; Joiner, 2005; Van Orden et al., 2010), and the potential integration of these factors, in explaining SI in this population. A convenience sample of 816 TGNC adults responded to measures of current SI, gender minority stressors, and IPTS factors. Path analysis was utilized to test 2 models. Model 1 evaluated the associations between external minority stressors and SI through internal minority stressors. Model 2 examined the relationships between internal minority stressors and SI through IPTS variables (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness). All GMSR external stressors (rejection, nonaffirmation, victimization, and discrimination), internal stressors (internalized transphobia, negative expectations, and nondisclosure), and IPTS factors (thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness) were related to SI. Both models demonstrated good fit. Model 1 revealed that rejection, nonaffirmation, and victimization were related to SI through experiences of internalized transphobia and negative expectations. Model 2 indicated that internalized transphobia and negative expectations were associated with SI through IPTS factors. The models demonstrate pathways through which GMSR and IPTS constructs relate to one another and confer risk for SI among TGNC individuals. These pathways and several recently proposed constructs examined here provide promising directions for future research and clinical interventions in this area.

  {"id":"Ullrich'20","abstract":"Most functional languages rely on some kind of garbage collection for automatic memory management. They usually eschew reference counting in favor of a tracing garbage collector, which has less bookkeeping overhead at runtime. On the other hand, having an exact reference count of each value can enable optimizations such as destructive updates. We explore these optimization opportunities in the context of an eager, purely functional programming language. We propose a new mechanism for efficiently reclaiming memory used by nonshared values, reducing stress on the global memory allocator. We describe an approach for minimizing the number of reference counts updates using borrowed references and a heuristic for automatically inferring borrow annotations. We implemented all these techniques in a new compiler for an eager and purely functional programming language with support for multi-threading. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate our approach is competitive and often outperforms state-of-the-art compilers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ullrich","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Moura","given":"Leonardo","non-dropping-particle":"de"}],"citation-key":"Ullrich'20","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,5]]},"language":"en","number":"arXiv:1908.05647","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Counting Immutable Beans: Reference Counting Optimized for Purely Functional Programming","title-short":"Counting Immutable Beans","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05647"},

  {"id":"Wallace'","abstract":"While utilizing the case of the crack cocaine epidemic, this article analyzes the quarter century of drug policy that began with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, while ending with the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 that took effect November 1, 2011. The analysis illustrates the importance of those working in public health engaging in both the monitoring of emergent health-related policy and persistent evidence-based advocacy in order to reverse and replace flawed or unjust policy. The analysis covers the following: (1) the importance of paying attention to policy, relevant public health questions, and illustrative answers when analyzing the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (2) the social context surrounding passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 and the controversial 100-to-1 drug quantity ratio; (3) the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988—which added insult to the prior injury embodied in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986; (4) the resultant racial disparities in sentencing, law enforcement, prosecution, and cumulative racial disparities; (5) significant developments in the new millennium that highlighted the need for urgent change across the criminal justice system; (6) the Fair Sentencing act of 2010 that went into effect November 1, 2011—25 years after the 1986 Act; (7) the issue of retroactive application of the new sentencing guidelines and the risk of ongoing injustice; (8) the thousands of incarcerated mostly Black males waiting for justice, as evidence of ongoing national impact from the crack epidemic and racial disparities in sentencing; (9) the 2013 case of the United States v.

  {"id":"Wang'14","abstract":"Driver behavior is one of the most important aspects in the design, development, and application of Advanced Driving Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which can be affected by many factors. To study the effect of human factors in driving, a simulator with Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Driver-in-the-Loop (DIL), and an instrumented vehicle were developed to quantitatively measure the driver actions, vehicle status, and the relationship with the vehicle. A comparative analysis of the differences was carried out in a driving simulator and also in the real-world environment. After 33 various driver experiments were conducted, a set of special data-processing programs were also developed to review, extract, and analyze the captured data. Some representative parameters such as time to collision (TTC) and time headway (THW) are adopted to analyze and compare the effect of human factors, which include age, gender, driving experience, workload, education level, and nationality. Finally, to ensure the consistency of classifications based on subjective evaluation and objective experimental data, tests including the completion of a driver behavior questionnaire (DBQ) and real-world driving were conducted with 52 participants and compared. Factor analysis theory was applied to the data processing and characteristic extractions. The results of the study indicated that there were significant differences between the subjective evaluation and objective data, i.e. the subjective evaluation was not reliable enough for algorithm design, although it can be used as a reference.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Jianqiang"},{"family":"Li","given":"Keqiang"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Xiao-Yun"}],"citation-key":"Wang'14","container-title":"Advances in Intelligent Vehicles","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-12-397199-9.00005-7","editor":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Yaobin"},{"family":"Li","given":"Lingxi"}],"event-place":"Boston","ISBN":"978-0-12-397199-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"111-157","publisher":"Academic Press","publisher-place":"Boston","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 5 - Effect of Human Factors on Driver Behavior","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123971999000057"},

An intimate portrait of a family and an epic tale of hope and struggle, Sing, Unburied, Sing journeys through Mississippi’s past and present, examining the ugly truths at the heart of the American story and the power—and limitations—of family bonds.  Jojo is thirteen years old and trying to understand what it means to be a man. He doesn’t lack in fathers to study, chief among them his Black grandfather, Pop. But there are other men who complicate his understanding: his absent White father, Michael, who is being released from prison; his absent White grandfather, Big Joseph, who won’t acknowledge his existence; and the memories of his dead uncle, Given, who died as a teenager.  His mother, Leonie, is an inconsistent presence in his and his toddler sister’s lives. She is an imperfect mother in constant conflict with herself and those around her. She is Black and her children’s father is White. She wants to be a better mother but can’t put her children above her own needs, especially her drug use. Simultaneously tormented and comforted by visions of her dead brother, which only come to her when she’s high, Leonie is embattled in ways that reflect the brutal reality of her circumstances.  When the children’s father is released from prison, Leonie packs her kids and a friend into her car and drives north to the heart of Mississippi and Parchman Farm, the State Penitentiary. At Parchman, there is another thirteen-year-old boy, the ghost of a dead inmate who carries all of the ugly history of the South with him in his wandering. He too has something to teach Jojo about fathers and sons, about legacies, about violence, about love.  Rich with Ward’s distinctive, lyrical language, Sing, Unburied, Sing is a majestic new work and an unforgettable family story.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,12,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ward","given":"Jesmyn"}],"citation-key":"Ward'17","collection-number":"2","collection-title":"Bois Sauvage","edition":"First Edition/First Printing","event-place":"New York","ISBN":"978-1-5011-2606-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,9,5]]},"language":"English","number-of-pages":"304","publisher":"Scribner","publisher-place":"New York","source":"Amazon","title":"Sing, Unburied, Sing: A Novel","title-short":"Sing, Unburied, Sing","type":"book"},

  {"id":"Wellisch'95","abstract":"Drug treatment in the United States has been fragmented, underfunded, less than comprehensive, and poorly planned and integrated. To bring about a significant improvement in the number of drug abusers who receive treatment and in the effectiveness of the treatment they receive, the current fragmented approach needs to be replaced with an integrated, coherent system of drug treatment. This paper discusses the characteristics of a drug treatment system and focuses on two elements of such a system: the use of the health care and criminal justice systems as locations to identify persons in need of drug treatment, and matching clients with appropriate services to improve treatment effectiveness. The paper also discusses several issues that will need to be addressed in developing a drug treatment system, offers examples at the federal, state, and local levels indicative of trends in the direction of a systems approach to drug treatment, and emphasizes the importance of federal leadership in systems development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Wellisch","given":"Jean"},{"family":"Prendergast","given":"Michael L."},{"family":"Anglin","given":"M.

  {"id":"Wendel'78a","abstract":"In integrated navigation systems Kalman filters are widely used to increase the accuracy and reliability of the navigation solution. Usually, an indirect Kalman filter formulation is applied to estimate the errors of an INS strapdown algorithm (SDA), which are used to correct the SDA. In contrast to that, in the direct Kalman filter formulation total quantities like position, velocity and attitude are among the state variables of the filter, which allows them to be estimated directly. This contribution investigates the influence of these two different approaches of Kalman filtering on the overall system performance of a loosely coupled GPS/INS sys-tem for aerospace applications. Both filter formulations were implemented and compared via Monte Carlo sim-ulation runs with focus on the accuracy of the estimated inertial sensor biases and on GPS drop out situations. We found a comparable performance of both navigation algorithms concerning attitude and position errors as well as inertial sensor bias estimation as long as GPS aiding was available. However, the simulation results indicate a superior performance of the direct Kalman filter formulation in GPS drop out situations, which can by explained by the way the inertial measurements are processed.","author":[{"family":"Wendel","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Schlaile","given":"C"},{"family":"Trommer","given":"Gert"}],"citation-key":"Wendel'78a","issued":{"date-parts":[[1978,1,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Direct Kalman Filtering of GPS/INS for Aerospace Applications","type":"article-journal"},

The applied social ecological model employed here elucidates that transgender stigma operates at multiple levels (i.e., individual, interpersonal, structural) to impact health. Stigma prevention and coping interventions hold promise for reducing stigma and its adverse health-related effects in transgender populations.\n\nConclusion\nAdditional research is needed to document the causal relationship between stigma and adverse health as well as the mediators and moderators of stigma in US transgender populations.

  {"id":"Xi99","abstract":"We present an approach to enriching the type system of ML with a restricted form of dependent types, where type index objects are drawn from a constraint domain C, leading to the DML(C) language schema. This allows specification and inference of significantly more precise type information, facilitating program error detection and compiler optimization. A major complication resulting from introducing dependent types is that pure type inference for the enriched system is no longer possible, but we show that type-checking a sufficiently annotated program in DML(C) can be reduced to constraint satisfaction in the constraint domain C. We exhibit the unobtrusiveness of our approach through practical examples and prove that DML(C) is conservative over ML. The main contribution of the paper lies in our language design, including the formulation of type-checking rules which makes the approach practical. To our knowledge, no previous type system for a general purpose programming language such as ML has combined dependent types with features including datatype declarations, higher-order functions, general recursions, let-polymorphism, mutable references, and exceptions. In addition, we have finished a prototype implementation of DML(C) for an integer constraint domain C, where constraints are linear inequalities (Xi and Pfenning 1998).","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Xi","given":"Hongwei"},{"family":"Pfenning","given":"Frank"}],"citation-key":"Xi99","collection-title":"POPL '99","container-title":"Proceedings of the 26th ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT symposium on Principles of programming languages","DOI":"10.1145/292540.292560","event-place":"New York, NY, USA","ISBN":"978-1-58113-095-9","issued":{"date-parts":[[1999,1,1]]},"page":"214–227","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Dependent types in practical programming","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1145/292540.292560"},

  {"id":"Zimmerman'14","abstract":"In 1986, the United States government attempted to combat the perceived war on drugs by enacting mandatory drug laws, with a primary focus on incarcerating crack offenders. The result of this was a mass influx of African Americans to US penitentiaries and minimal to zero reduction of crack convictions. Because the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 recognized 100 grams of cocaine as equivalent to one gram of crack, it has been perceived not as a war on drugs, but as a war on a war on minorities. The mass incarceration of drug offenders also led to severely damaging fiscal consequences that were forced onto the nation’s taxpayers. In November 2010, President Obama signed the Fair Sentencing Act, which decreased the imbalanced ratio of 100:1 to 18:1. The Fair Sentencing Act, named by the United States government, is still unfair. Until Congress and the Sentencing Commission agree that one gram of cocaine is equivalent to one gram of crack, justice has not been served.","author":[{"family":"Zimmerman","given":"Kristin"}],"citation-key":"Zimmerman'14","DOI":"10.31979/THEMIS.2014.0210","issued":{"date-parts":[[2014]]},"language":"en","page":"18","source":"Zotero","title":"The Unfair Sentencing Act: Racial Disparities and Fiscal Consequences of America's Drug Laws","type":"article-journal"},
