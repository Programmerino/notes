# Overview
Minority stress theory is the composite of the following ideas:
1. Being in a minority group is associated with increased exposure to prejudice and discrimination ([[definition of distal stressor]])
2. Exposure to prejudice and discrimination leads to internal stress ([[definition of proximal stressor]])
3. Exposure to distal and proximal stress creates adverse health outcomes
