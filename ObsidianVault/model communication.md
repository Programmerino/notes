The interconnections between [[actor]]s in [[CPS models]] are the communication paths which carry [[signal]]s consisting of communication events (for [[Discrete Dynamics in CPS|discrete]] signals, these are modeled by the state machine [[behavior]] formula where a communication event is a non-absent value)
