Harmonic distortion is a [[nonlinearity]] of [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s when the [[sensitivity]] is dependent on the [[magnitude]] of the [[CPS signal]] and is modeled by some power of the underlying physical quantity.

For example, second harmonic distortion can be modeled with, given a physical quantity $x(t)$, $f(x(t))=a x(t)+b+d_2(x(t))^2$ 

When $d_2$ is small, there is little distortion and the model is roughly an [[affine model]], otherwise, it is distorted.
