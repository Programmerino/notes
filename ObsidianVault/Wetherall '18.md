#### Definition of ideation-to-action and IPTS
The development of suicidal ideation and the transition to a suicide  
attempt are viewed as distinct processes (Klonsky et al., 2017). The first theoretical model to  
emphasise this distinction was the interpersonal-psychological theory of suicide (IPT; Joiner,  
2005), proposing that suicidal desire (comprised of perceived burdensomeness and  
thwarted belongingness) alone was insufficient to lead to a serious suicide attempt/death  
by suicide.
