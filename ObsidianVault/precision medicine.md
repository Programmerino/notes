A strategy for treating multiple forms of [[cancer]] with the same [[drug]] based on the patient's [[somatic changes]], and have multiple mechanisms:
* Inhibiting [[enzyme]]s which trigger abnormal [[cell growth]].
* Blocking aberrant [[gene expression]] characteristic of [[cancer]] [[cell]]s.
* Halting molecular signaling pathways in overdrive in [[cancer]] [[cell]]s.

By using a targeted therapy, the [[side effects]] of affecting healthy [[cell]]s can be reduced (e.g., [[chemotherapy]], [[radiation therapy]]).
