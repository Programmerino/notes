A digital [[sensor]] is a [[sensor]] bundled with an [[analog-to-digital converter]], and necessarily has less precision than the raw signal provided by a [[analog sensor]].

An ideal digital [[sensor]] has a precision of ![[Pasted image 20230119112209.png]] where $n$ is the number of bits used to store output values, and a [[dynamic range]] ![[Pasted image 20230119112227.png]].
