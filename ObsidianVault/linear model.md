Suppose a [[sensor]] is trying to approximate some physical quantity $x(t)$, where the approximation is $f(x(t))$. That [[sensor]] can be approximated with a linear model if there is some value $a \in \mathbb{R}$ such that for all $x(t) \in \mathbb{R}$, $f(x(t)) = ax(t)$. This value $a$ is called the **proportionality constant** and is a metric of [[sensitivity]].

In other words, a [[sensor]] which can be well-modeled with a linear model simply multiplies the true physical quantity. All [[linear model]]s are [[affine model]]s with zero bias.

These insights also work for [[actuator]]s.
