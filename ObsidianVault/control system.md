A control system is comprised of:
* A system called the plant (physical process to be controlled)
* The environment of the plant
* The controller which determines the mode transition structure (supervisory control) and selects the time-based inputs for the plant (low-level control)
	* These can be modeled well with [[hybrid systems modeling|hybrid systems]].
