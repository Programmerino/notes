A history [[transition]] in the context of [[hierarchical composition]] means that any destination [[state refinement|refinements]] will resume in the [[state]] it was previously in, or in the initial [[state]] if its the first time. This is opposed to a [[reset transition]] which does not "resume". It is represented graphically with an "H" near the destination of the [[transition]] with a solid arrowhead (see [[Pasted image 20221225145258.png|here]])
