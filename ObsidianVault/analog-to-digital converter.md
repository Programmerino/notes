An $n$-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) converts the voltage produced by a [[sensor]] to an $n$-bit number which can be processed by digital computers. The [[quantization error]] is reduced the more bits the ADC uses, although there are other techniques to reduce this (see [[quantization error]]).

It is typically the case that a balance between precision and speed is chosen. A [[bang-bang controller]] is an example prioritizing speed.
