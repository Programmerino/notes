When using a [[deterministic state machine]] under the [[synchronous-reactive MoC]], the **firing function** is a function mapping the [[input]] value to the [[output]] value.

In the context of [[dataflow MoC]], it is a function representing an [[actor]] which maps a finite portion of an [[input]] sequence to an [[output]] sequence.
