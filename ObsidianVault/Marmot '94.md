### Summary
Attempts to explain the link between wealth and increased life expectancy. Previous evidence has indicated a relationship between life expectancy and Gross National Product per capita (GNPpc) with diminishing returns after $5,000. Improvement in life expectancy is not uniform across industrialized countries (see graphic below):

It is also not intersectionally uniform:

Thomas McKeown has made the case that advancements in health came primarily from nutritional and environmental change rather than advances in medical care ([[McKeown '77#Mortality link with nutrition]]) and there is evidence that expanding medical coverage is unlikely to have a substantial impact on socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. Despite high US expenditure on healthcare, it has one of the worst life expectancies among OECD countries. The following demonstrates the impact of power in the workplace on mortality:

This data was taken from a relatively homogenous population of the same ethnic group in office jobs without exposure to danger in the workplace, and in the same area. There is a threefold difference between the highest and lowest positions in the hierarchy. They also found that less power is highly correlated with the amount of sick leave used:
