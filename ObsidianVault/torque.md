* In [[CPS]]...
	* $\mathbf{T}(t)=\frac{d}{d t}(\mathbf{I}(t) \dot{\theta}(t))$ where $\textbf{I}(t)$ is the **moment of inertia tensor** of the object (3x3 matrix based on the geometry and orientation of the object)
		* Yields a 3D vector as a function of time
		* For spheres, $I(t)$ can be replaced with a single constant scalar $I$. This is an example of [[model-order reduction]].
