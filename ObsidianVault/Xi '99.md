## Xi '99 Forum Description
### Introduction, Target Audience, and Purpose
POPL (ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages) is an open-access conference with a primary focus on topics related to programming languages. The conference receives the [[CORE '13|highest grade possible from the Computing Research & Education organization]], so the purpose of the conference is likely to platform high quality research from well-respected researchers in the field of PLT (Programming Language Theory). Finally, the target audience is likely other academics or software developers well-versed in the mathematical background of programming language theory.
### Visuals and Length
On a visual/structural level, the articles use a few instances of code illustrations but are primarily characterized by math blocks, with most following a standard induction rule format. Longer elements are pushed to the end of the paper in the appendix, while most information is kept in-line. The article analyzed here is around 6000 words long, moderately longer than the article published by PragPub.
## Xi '99 Summary
We add dependent types to ML which allows better error detection and optimization, which has not been previously done. Functional type systems are realistic or unrealistic. Realistic systems end up being overly simple, which prevents them from catching certain issues. An example from our implementation is that append creates a list of length m + n when given lists of length m and n. Next, it raises necessary questions to answer for their system, and then answers them, using previous research and some anecdotal evidence. It describes how other solutions overly rely on excessive annotations while DML(C) (their solution), does not. It then begins to describe semantics details of the language (syntax, etc.), using example code blocks, formal grammars, and inductive rules. This is mixed in occasionally with discussion about the ramifications of certain decisions, and proofs that these decisions are consistent. They then create a second-level language which is more practical for programmers by omitting certain type details. Finally, it provides three examples where the addition of dependent types created some benefit (fewer errors, optimizations), describes related works, and then future plans to enrich their language.
