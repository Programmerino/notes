In [[concurrent composition]], it is when two or more [[state machine]]s [[reaction|react]] independently rather than synchronously (i.e., the opposite of [[synchronous composition]]).

There are two main options for semantics and meanings for "independent":
* [[interleaving semantics]]
* [[Semantics 2]]
