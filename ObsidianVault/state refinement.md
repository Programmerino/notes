A state refinement in the context of a [[finite-state machine]] in a [[hybrid systems modeling|hybrid system]] associates some relation with the dynamic [[output]]s of the [[CPS|system]] or [[continuous-time system|continuous]] [[state]] variables with each [[state]]. See the [[thermostat hybrid system]] for an example.

In the context of [[hierarchical composition]], it refers to a [[finite-state machine]] contained in a [[state machine]] using [[hierarchical composition]].

## modal model
When using this, the [[hybrid systems modeling|hybrid system]] can be described as a **modal [[CPS models|model]]** since the dynamics of the [[actor]] have different "modes" associated with each [[state]] in the [[finite-state machine]].
