In a [[state machine]], each [[port]] will take on a sequence of values over a sequence of [[CPS reaction]]s which can be represented as $s_p : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow V_p \cup \{absent\}$. An instance of the sequences of the [[input]]s and [[output]]s is a behavior. See [[counter state machine]] for an example.
