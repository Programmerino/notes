* T1D is caused by the pancreas being unable to secrete enough insulin, so patients typically use a manual insulin infusion pump which can cater their mealtimes, etc. (6-9 measurements a day, infusions throughout the day). The short-term and long-term consequences of improper infusions can be significant
* An artificial pancreas (AP) can deliver insulin automatically based on recently advanced glucose sensor tech. The stages are...
	* Pump shutoff - shuts down the pump and alarms when glucose is too low
	* Predictive pump shutoff - shuts down the pump in anticipation of a low in the next 30-70 minutes
	* Hybrid closed loop - Basal insulin delivery (non-mealtime)
	* Fully automatic closed loop - Basal and automatic meal boluses
	* Multihormone closed loop - Uses glucagon to increase gluclose as well, uses amylin to control food digestion
* Formal verification to verify that failures don't occur in deployed use
	* "unannounced meals, exercise, sensor noise, erroneous sensor readings, pressure induced sensor attenuation, set failures, and patient physiological changes"
