An $n$-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC) converts an $n$-bit digital number into an analog voltage which can drive an [[actuator]]. The number of bits determines the number of distinct actions the DAC can potentially take.

High-power [[actuator]]s cannot often be directly driven from the DAC, and instead the DAC is usually used in conjunction with [[pulse width modulation]] and [[switch]] or a power amplifier which serves the purpose of providing additional voltage (however, this causes some degree of [[nonlinearity]]).
