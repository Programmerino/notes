Most people associate words like "racism" with not only it's base meaning, but with an inherent immorality which means that instances of racism are a subset of instance of immorality. For example, we might predict that affirmative action (since it is an instance of discrimination on the basis of race) is an instance of racism, however, that doesn't appear to be true by most people's accounts.
