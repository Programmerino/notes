Instagram:
* Photo-based
	* This makes the platform focused on sharing aspects of your life, photos of yourself, etc. since other areas you see on other platforms (politics, jokes, etc.) are harder to do with an image
* Politics are non-argumentative (stories) since replies are private, they typically require a graphic to be made before they can be shared, and are more focused since the ecosystem promotes sharing opinions you've already seen
Twitter:
* Sharing hot takes
* More anonymized
* Text-based
* Twitter is more argumentative since you always have the threat of getting ratio'd, and it also seems to allow controversial posts to succeed where they probably would fail on Instagram since they require other people to copy and share it
