# Academic vs. popular descriptions in PLT
## Introduction
In this analysis, I aim to identify and analyze key rhetorical distinctions between academic and popular sources in the field of programming language theory through a case study of articles written about dependent type systems. The first article was published in a conference proceeding, while the second was published in a magazine intended for “pragmatic programmers”. Since a common criticism of academia is its lack of practicality, these two articles should be contrasting enough to allow for sufficient analysis.
