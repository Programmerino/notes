* Alexander was born in 356 BC and died in 323 BC
	* Defeated the Persians and captured their empire and Egypt
	* There is mass immigration to Athens because Socrates is there (very popular)
	* Stoics, skeptics, and Epicurus were not impacted by Aristotle which is why Hellenistic philosophy is unique.
* The schools of Athens in ~300 BC were:
	* Epicurus' Garden “Stranger, your time will be pleasant here. Here, the highest good is pleasure.”
	* Plato's Academy was the first university and has a slogan “Let no one ignorant of geometry enter here”
	* Aristotle's Lyceum
	* Zeno's *Stoa Poikile*
* Zeno and Epicurus both believed that self-change could answer environmental issues.
* Aristotle on his immigration to be taught by Plato was a pharmacist, soldier, drug dealer, and mercenary
* Plato thought pleasure was dangerous, Aristotle thought that pleasure was a dangerous sole goal
* Epicurus was a fan of pleasure
* Leibniz
	* Locke, Descartes, Hume, etc. all made the same mistake of not recognizing abstract objects. Plato and Aristotle didn't make this mistake
	* He created the laws of identity
		* The Identity of Indiscernibles states that $\forall F (F(x) \leftrightarrow F(y)) \rightarrow x = y$
			* This means that two distinct objects have at least one differing property between them.
			* McTaggart called this the “The Dissimilarity of the Diverse”
		* The Indiscernibility of Identicals states that $x = y \rightarrow \forall F (F(x) \leftrightarrow F(y))$
		* Even two objects identical save for being in different locations are indiscernible since there isn't a legitimate way to identify the space they take up.
	* When people refer to their identity, they truly refer to their essence.
		* An essence is something that is required of an object for it to continue to exist. Aristotle would say that someone who hit their head and could no longer be rational has lost their essence and is thus no longer human
		* Plato and Aristotle believe in essence, but Hellenistic philosophers don't have a similar concept.
* Hylomorphism is the idea that objects are composed of components of matter and form
	* Aristotle believed in this.
	* The matter and form are considered to be inseparable for the object to continue existing.
	* Epicureans and the stoics did not use this belief.
		* This prevents them
	* Aristotle believes that the essence of a person is an animal with rationality, and that anything short of animals is insufficient.
		* Aristotle would then believe that an uploaded version of someone is not a person
	* John Locke believes that the essence of a person is their memories.
	* Some others believe the essence of a person is an uninterrupted non-supernatural causal sequence
		* Descartes believes this
		* Sleeping wrecks this.
* Epicurus took the idea of material objects being all divisible to atoms from Democritus, who had a similar idea.
* An essentialist thought experiment is that if you were transported to an identical earth during your sleep, but the water's molecular structure changed to XYZ, would the thought “I like this water” on either planet be the same?
* You don't necessarily need to believe in people having an essence if you believe they never cease to exist.
* Epicureans and stoics believe in the identity of indiscernibles. This allows for skepticism.
* Skeptics claim that people don't have clear judgements since there are very small properties of objects which cannot be perceived.
