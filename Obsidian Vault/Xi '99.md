## Xi '99 Forum Description
### Introduction, Target Audience, and Purpose
POPL (ACM SIGPLAN-SIGACT Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages) is an open-access conference with a primary focus on topics related to programming languages. The conference receives the [[CORE '13|highest grade possible from the Computing Research & Education organization]], so the purpose of the conference is likely to platform high quality research from well-respected researchers in the field of PLT (Programming Language Theory). Finally, the target audience is likely other academics or software developers well-versed in the mathematical background of programming language theory.
### Visuals and Length
On a visual/structural level, the articles use a few instances of code illustrations but are primarily characterized by math blocks, with most following a standard induction rule format. Longer elements are pushed to the end of the paper in the appendix, while most information is kept in-line. The article analyzed here is around 6000 words long, moderately longer than the article published by PragPub.
