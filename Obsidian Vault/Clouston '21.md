#### FCT Description
The repeated emergence of health inequalities across places and times signifies that the associations in question emerge even though the types of diseases and their attendant risk and protective factors change from place to place and from time to time. ==Fundamental cause theory (FCT) was proposed to help understand the persistence of associations between SES and morbidity and mortality despite the fact that the diseases afflicting humans, and the risk and protective factors influencing those diseases, changed substantially across time and place==. ==Associations== between SES and disease ==persist==, claimed FCT, ==because risk and protective factors linking SES to health in one context were replaced by new mechanisms at a different place and time==.
