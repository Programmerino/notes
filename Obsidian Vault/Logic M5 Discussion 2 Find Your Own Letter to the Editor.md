1. P(x) = In order to be successful in $x$, you should prefer options which are more successful at achieving $x$
2. $P(\text{dating})$
3. Online dating is an option for dating
4. Q(x) = x causes swiping right and not matching -> x is less successful
5. Q(online dating)
6. R(x) = x causes dates which don't spark -> x is less successful
7. R(online dating)
8. S(x) = x causes being ghosted by people you like -> x is less successful
9. S(online dating)
10. T(x) = Q(x) and R(x) and S(x) -> x is a bad option for dating
11. T(online dating)
12. U(x) = the writer did x and x worked -> x is more successful
13. U(dating a friend)
14. V(x) = x produces happier, stronger relationships on average -> x is more successful
15. V(dating a friend)
16. You have a relationship which has friendship-based intimacy -> the relationship is happier
17. Dating a friend -> you have a relationship which has a friendship-based intimacy
18. Options which produce happier relationships are more successful
19. You have a relationship in which both partners understand that the other partner likes them for non-superficial reasons -> the relationship is more trustworthy
20. A trustworthy relationship is happier
21. Dating a friend -> you have a relationship in which both partners understand that the other partner likes them for non-superficial reasons
23. Therefore, dating a friend is a good way to date

I think the argument is reasonably sound. The logic is all valid, although I think that some of the arguments against online dating aren't nuanced. For example, I think that Q(x) is not as problematic since there is a much greater volume of "swiping right" to the equivalent in normal dating strategies. U(x) makes an anecdotal argument which I consider to be false. However, the article makes several arguments which prove the same conclusion (redundant arguments), so these points can be false while the argument is still sound.
