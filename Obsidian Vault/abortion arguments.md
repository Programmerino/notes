Pro:
[[The Repugnant Conclusion]] can be used to "no impact" claims towards unjustly killing a life
[[Thomson's Argument]] is an argument by analogy

Con:


# Loki's Wager
[[Loki's Wager]] is typically a pro-abortion defense against anti-abortion arguments which point out that pro-abortion advocates are unable to pinpoint where life or consciousness begins to demonstrate their absurdity in argument.
