#### Distal stressor and proximal stressor definition
The Minority Stress Model (Meyer 2003) describes stress  
processes among LGB people that contribute to a higher prev-  
alence of mental health concerns compared to heterosexual  
people. LGB people encounter distal and proximal minority  
stress, which extends beyond the general stress that everyone  
experiences. ==Distal stressors are external prejudice== events ==di-  
rected toward a person== (e.g., heterosexist discrimination, vic-  
timization, and homonegative microaggressions). ==Proximal  
stressors are== a person’s ==internal== or subjective ==responses==  
(Meyer 2003). Distal stressors refer to an event (e.g., being  
called a heterosexist slur), and proximal stressors involve an  
appraisal of the event (e.g., internalizing LGB bias). There are  
three major proximal stressors: expectations of rejection, in-  
ternalized homophobia, and concealment of one’s LGB iden-  
tity. Expectations of rejection is the extent to which people  
expect to be stigmatized by others, internalized homophobia  
regards self-directed antigay attitudes, and concealment is hid-  
ing an LGB identity (Meyer 2003). Distal stressors are theo-  
rized to contribute to the development of proximal stressors.
