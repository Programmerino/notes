* Descartes believed that a person was responsible for consequences, even in the presence of a god. He believed that if people didn't have a clear and distinct idea for what action to take, to not take any action (Meditation 4)
	* Hellenistic philosophers agree with this.
	* Skeptics claim that you probably can't agree with this and Leibniz's idea of identity because there can be microscopic differences in your perception of the environment to the actual environment, which means you would make actions without clear, distinct ideas.
		* Stoics deal with binary classifications by saying there is a distinct point between the two.
* Atoraxia is freedom from judgement
* Survival is used as an alternative to identity for “sameness”:
	* If a person is carbon copied and the original is eliminated, are they the same person before the process?
	* This illustrates the problem of diachronic identity (identity over time)
* Democritean atoms:
	* Atoms of all shapes, in all quantities, and all sizes because there isn't a reason to prefer one shape over another (indifference reasoning)
	* They infinitely fall down into the void, like raindrops
	* Epicurus wanted to know what makes an atom distinct from another.
* Stoic "atoms" are causers and subjects of cause
* The fundamental start of cause is Zeus and the fundamental receiver of cause is Hera according to the stoics
* Epicurean Atomism
	* He believes atoms are real.
	* They are *per se* (in themselves) existents
	* He assumes the existence of a void which is an intangible substances
* Stoics defined matter as 3D substances which are resistant to touch
