Consequentialism is the maximization of a certain, or multiple, moral goods across the most people.

## Interpretative Comments
Below covers specific issues with how this definition should be interpreted, and not issues with Consequentialism as a general idea:

### Unborn People
Whether or not unborn people should be included in moral analysis is a difficult question, with intuitively moral scenarios being excluded/included on each side.

For example, many pro-abortion arguments claim that if the baby were to live, their life would be of poor quality (because the mother isn't financially stable enough, is too young or inexperienced to be satisfactory, wouldn't have a father, etc.), or make an argument from [[The Repugnant Conclusion]] to disavow the inherent value to the baby's life (see below)

On the other hand, including unborn people has the issue of how to prioritize quantity against quality in a non-arbitrary fashion. If you choose quantity, then you run into [[The Repugnant Conclusion]] where you end up with a world which looks terrible from any intuitive sense (see [[the balance between moral systems and intuition]]).

#### Solutions
The most appealing solution to me is to interpret consequentialism as an assessment of the impacts of an action to each person, and then to average these impacts across the entire population. Obviously, this is an impractical undertaking, but the implication is that you can use the conventional standard for consequentialism while assessing only unborn people which are brought about by the action, and by only assessing them to the extent that they are happier or sadder than the average other person (if they are happier, then they are seen as a moral good, and a moral bad otherwise)
