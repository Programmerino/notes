# Detail Notes
* Target audience
* Forum purpose
* How do visual details differ
* Types of text published
* Article length
* Writer requirements

* I like the formatting and setup of your analysis.
* The focus seems to be the visual structure and forum setting. Likely a result of the rough draft phase, the final draft would benefit from more analysis of actual word choice and how you know the intended audience you describe (examples and direct contrasts)
* Will you later discuss the implications of the article content?
