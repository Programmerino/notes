* Similar
* Contrasting
	* The NYT article's purpose is to outline the impacts of the paper while the paper, while also having a focus on these impacts, is much more heavily focused on demonstrating the methods they used for their conclusion
	* The target audience is different which impacts the language used
		* The NYT article is sure to explain each scientific term used before using it
		* The JACP article, while notably sometimes also explaining terms like climate forcing, uses language that is certainly more adapted for the scientific community
	* The JACP article simply presents findings and the methods used for those findings while the NYT includes opinion intertwined with the underlying evidence
		* For example, "The likely consequences would include killer storms stronger than any in modern times, the disintegration of large parts of the polar ice sheets and a rise of the sea sufficient to begin drowning the world’s coastal cities before the end of this century, the scientists declared. “We’re in danger of handing young people a situation that’s out of their control,” said James E. Hansen, the retired NASA climate scientist who led the new research. The findings were released Tuesday morning by a European science journal, Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics."
	* The NYT article is more interested in the backgrounds of authors and surrounding scientists to the paper, while the JACP article is completely uninterested in these details.
